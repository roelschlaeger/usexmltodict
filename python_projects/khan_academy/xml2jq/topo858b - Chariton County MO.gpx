   <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;A quick park and find located along a fairly busy section of rural Missouri Highway.  Muggles could be heavy depending on the time of day so some discretion may be needed. &lt;/p&gt;
Oh yeah, watch that poison ivy!</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;Juniperus virginiana is a dense slow-growing coniferous evergreen tree that may never become more than a bush on poor soil, but is ordinarily from 16–66 ft (rarely to 89 ft) tall, with a short trunk 12–39 in (rarely 67 in) diameter. The oldest tree reported, from Missouri was 795 years old. The bark is reddish-brown, fibrous, and peels off in narrow strips. The leaves are of two types; sharp, spreading needle-like juvenile leaves 2.0–3.9 in long, and tightly adpressed scale-like adult leaves 0.079–0.16 in long.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It is a pioneer invader, which means that it is one of the first trees to repopulate cleared, eroded, or otherwise damaged land. It is unusually long lived among pioneer species, with the potential to live over 850 years. The tree is commonly found in prairies or oak barrens, old pastures, or limestone hills, often along highways and near recent construction sites.  This cache is located in the vicinity of one of these trees. &lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Was in the area with Cribbage Witch - On our frequent route from St. Louis to St Joseph Area and back through KC to visit with the Folks in Maysville and the kids in KC.  We decided to pick up a few caches to give ourselves time to stretch.    Even though the trip was about double the length, Geocaching seemed to make it feel it went twice as fast.    Thanks for putting these out to make our trip more enjoyable today.</groundspeak:text>

Parking was easy, though drew a couple of awkward stares from people driving by since I was parked facing the wrong way. I think this is my favorite cedar tree. I'm tired of having to reach between their branches to retrieve a cache that someone slid under a cedar. This tree was so big I could stand under the branches!.I felt like I was making a truce with nature, however temporary it may be. Deschlager went crazy leaving their trackables here.

   <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This should be an easy Park and Grab. There is room to Park within about 10 feet of the cache. This is a camouflage matchstick container with not much room for tradeables. Bring your own pen. In the summer there could be tall weeds and after a rain water standing on your short walk to the cache. If you look off to the South West after as you make you walk you will see some of nice rolling hills and peaceful farm land in the area. &lt;/p&gt;

Was in the area with Cribbage Witch - On our frequent route from St. Louis to St Joseph Area and back through KC to visit with the Folks in Maysville and the kids in KC.  We decided to pick up a few caches to give ourselves time to stretch.    Even though the trip was about double the length, Geocaching seemed to make it feel it went twice as fast.    Thanks for putting these out to make our trip more enjoyable today.</groundspeak:text>

Having completed a decent bicycle ride earlier in the day, heading out for a few caches seemed like a good way to round out the afternoon.  Traffic was somewhat heavy but manageable leaving Columbia on highway 63.  How curious!  Turning off to a very familiar road, I soon parked close to the coordinates.  The cache was in hand within minutes and its log signed.  Onward to the next!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">It's funny how things work out, sometimes...

Years ago, I decided to create two EarthCaches at the Pinnacles Youth Park. Figuring another cache would be a bonus for people making the trek here, I hid an easy number bumper called "Pinnacles Park &amp; Grab" at this site. It got a decent amount of finds, but it also got muggled a few times, too. I would dutifully replace the cache and keep on keeping on. 

Cue the recent DNF's on this cache. Frankly getting tired of replacing it, I just archived the cache.

Imagine my surprise when I saw another cache in pretty much the same spot about a day later! It was also curious that it had a very similar name. Curious what the "strong" in the title meant, I emailed the cache owner. I told them that I was pleased to see the cache spot live on, but what does "strong" mean in this case?

Well, I got an email back. It turns out that the current cache owner was going to ask to adopt my cache or at least maintain it, but the cache got archived before they could. Oh yeah, the "strong" part was explained as well, but you'll have to go get this cache to get the reasoning.

Well, this brings me to today. I got to be a finder instead of an owner, today! I was out mushrooming and berry picking today, so I figured I'd make the drive up here to get the cache. I got to the cache area and parked. Following the obvious geo-trail, I got to ground zero and had cache in hand quickly.

I signed the log, put everything back and scurried on back toward Columbia. Thanks for the cache, and thanks for keeping this spot going! TNLN/SL TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

Seeing that I could potentially get a first to find on this one was motivation enough to head out in the geo-jeep and get it. I have a really good feeling as to why MSpry picked this spot for their cache and that makes me laugh and smile. Was there not a cache in this spot before??!! LOL !!!! hahahaha .... TFTC!

Now I only have 5 to go, but they will have to wait.  Also, filled a couple more dates on the calendar and added a few more counties in north central Missouri to the map.  Drove over 700 miles through rain, snow and sun, but it was all worth it for the joy of more smilies!  Thanks to all the CO’s for creating and maintaining these hides for my enjoyment, especially the old ones!  Cache on!

Quick find on my way back to Iowa.  Thanks for adding another MO county.  TNLN</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">If I’m learning anything about Missouri, it is that she likes to surprise when it comes to weather. Today, November Ghost, the geo-pibble and myself were graced with gloriously clear skies. It was chilly, but nothing we couldn’t handle! From Columbia, we made a large northern and western loop, with our main goals being to visit the Slurpin’ Soup and Watchin’ Eagles geo-event, add a few new counties to my map, and cache around Hannibal. Our trip took us to an abandoned house, an old bridge in a ghost town, a frozen spring by an icy river, and a treacherous (okay, only slightly) jaunt in the Jeep by a creek bed. Overall, it was an awesome day – one of those that remind you why geocaching is so much fun.

This was our last find of the night, and we worked for it! I was almost ready to call it when I spotted the well-camouflaged cache. I traded out TBs after signing the log. Thanks for the cache!</groundspeak:text>

County: Boone, Missouri
Delorme Grid: MO-030

Day 2 of my Midwest Journey to Geowoodstock XII from Des Moines, IA.  Today I started in Ottumwa, IA with some foggy weather and got into some rather stormy conditions as I made my way into Missouri.  Eventually I punched through a line of thunderstorms while moving west from Edina to Kirksville.  The rest of the day was quite delightful and the weather kept getting better and better before ending in Columbia, MO.  Most of my good friends going to GWS were well on their way to the event and I had hoped to see some on the journey, but I wound up not crossing paths with anyone though I evidently crossed paths with some of my Maryland friends near Macon or Moberly today.  Lots of fun caches to be had today!

An animal appears to have crawled onto a mound near the cache and died.  It was in a rather visually disturbing state of decomposition as I walked past it.  I really didn't want to gawk out it - but it looked like either a small dog or dog-like creature.  [V]

Cache wasn't too difficult to retrieve.  TFTC.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Nice easy stop off on my journey. The dead end road leading to the cache was a bit rough, so be careful. Also, if you are in a large vehicle or with a trailer you will have a hard time getting turned around to leave. I was in a nice small fuel efficient rental, so no problems for me today.
Thanks for placing this cache!

Part of my 4 day, 3,341 mile, 8 state, 3 province, $672 geocaching trip! The insane things we do for this hobby! Although tiring averaging over 800 miles/day, it was a truly amazing trip that colored in a lot of new territory on my map, brought me to some amazing places that I would never have gone to were it not for geocaching, and gave me plenty of time to reflect on life, family, and the beauty of the world in which we live. Special thanks to my amazing wife for allowing me to go off on this trip. Although she loves going with me when I geocache (most of the time) she was not interested in this kind of road trip LOL. I was able to move lots of trackables and find some great geocaches in the USA and Canada. Thanks to all the owners whose caches I chose to visit on my trip.

Was in the area with Cribbage Witch - On our frequent route from St. Louis to St Joseph Area and back through KC to visit with the Folks in Maysville and the kids in KC.  We decided to pick up a few caches to give ourselves time to stretch.    Even though the trip was about double the length, Geocaching seemed to make it feel it went twice as fast.    Thanks for putting these out to make our trip more enjoyable today.</groundspeak:text>

ScrapLadyS needed a ride-along buddy to go see her son pitch some college baseball, so what better than to make it a georoad trip?  We planned a few dozen caches, but time and distance prevented us from doing all of them.  No worries.  Better to have too many than too few.  This cache was one that we picked up during the weekend.  Thank you for placing it!

Some of these may be logged out of order due to some weird happening with the app.  They aren't in order there.  O.o</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">wrenberlin and I made the trek to Iowa for another state badge as neither of us had that state. Rainy drive there, snowy drive back. I have family ties to Ottumwa so we concentrated our caches in the area for the most part. After having lunch, caching, visiting grandparents and all around enjoying ourselves, it was time to head back ... in a snow storm ... in the dark ... going 30 MPH on the highway. Needless to say we stopped for the night in Kirksville, MO and decided to local cache in the snow and it turned out to be very fun!

this was the last cache on our Iowa adventure trip ... a good one to end the trip with. I discovered the TB there and wrenberlin took it to pass on down the road.  TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">November Ghost and myself + the geo-pibble decided this Saturday was a good day to find a cache in the great state of Iowa. Yes, that would be the same day a snowstorm was predicted to blow through. Despite logic, our adventurous streak prevailed, and we left from Columbia, MO, early in the day to visit Ottumwa, IA, where November Ghost has family roots. Ottumwa is quite charming! I learned how delicious a canteen lunch is while overhearing the locals discussing the brewing snow. Still un-phased by the talk of ferocious flurries, we spent the afternoon finding many fine caches. Our trip included a visit to Ghost’s past and a test of courage involving climbing up the slippery branches of a tree in the rain. You bet we exchanged some high fives after tackling that one. Around 5 or 6, it finally dawned on us that there was supposed to be some inclement weather on the way. Still, we dilly-dallied at a diner before finally getting out on the road as the sun was setting. Did I mention that I’m from the south, and that I’d never driven through snow before? November Ghost was behind the wheel… but that doesn’t mean he could actually see the road. And neither could I. I don’t think I’ve ever been that terrified due to weather. Now I know what those bumps on the sides of the lane are for! Driving blind proved to be much too stressful, so we stopped in Kirksville, MO for the night (and I found my first cache in the snow!) We made it home safe and sound on Sunday morning, and with a hearty respect for Mother Nature. Many thanks to all of the cachers who placed the hides we found on our trip!

Sunday morning, I woke up to a lovely blanket of snow and took the geo-pibble for a walk in it. Turns out, she loves snow! After a morning meetup at the golden arches for coffee, November Ghost and I took the jeep out to make some fresh tracks through the field of white. This was our last find of the trip. I feel we ended on a good one. I traded trackables. Thank you!</groundspeak:text>

Weather prediction was sunny and 50's for the day after Christmas.  I had not been out for a major cache run since July so I got permission from the muggle wife and our adventure was set.  We left before dawn and the plan was to return after sunset.  This was cache 2 for the day.   
  I've been by this on on few occasions but the grass was high and the ticks were thick and was not wearing appropriate gear for it.  This was the perfect time to grab this one as it's too cold for ticks and the grass was all beat down.  TNLNSL  TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

In Odessa, Mo. for non-geocaching affairs last night, we decided to make the most of it and stayed the night in Blue Springs to launch from there. We are looking forward to spending what looks to be a beautiful Spring Sunday caching across a new section of Missouri for us. We hope to light up 12 new Missouri counties while breaking our daily county record, adding a few others along the way.

Part of my 4 day, 3,341 mile, 8 state, 3 province, $672 geocaching trip! The insane things we do for this hobby! Although tiring averaging over 800 miles/day, it was a truly amazing trip that colored in a lot of new territory on my map, brought me to some amazing places that I would never have gone to were it not for geocaching, and gave me plenty of time to reflect on life, family, and the beauty of the world in which we live. Special thanks to my amazing wife for allowing me to go off on this trip. Although she loves going with me when I geocache (most of the time) she was not interested in this kind of road trip LOL. I was able to move lots of trackables and find some great geocaches in the USA and Canada. Thanks to all the owners whose caches I chose to visit on my trip.

Tried to get a picture of a cute little groundhog, but he/she only posed for a very short  time and then muttered something that sounded like "you're too slow" before running off into the bushes.

Weather prediction was sunny and 50's for the day after Christmas.  I had not been out for a major cache run since July so I got permission from the muggle wife and our adventure was set.  We left before dawn and the plan was to return after sunset.  This was cache 4 for the day.

County: Randolph, Missouri

Day 2 of my Midwest Journey to Geowoodstock XII from Des Moines, IA.  Today I started in Ottumwa, IA with some foggy weather and got into some rather stormy conditions as I made my way into Missouri.  Eventually I punched through a line of thunderstorms while moving west from Edina to Kirksville.  The rest of the day was quite delightful and the weather kept getting better and better before ending in Columbia, MO.  Most of my good friends going to GWS were well on their way to the event and I had hoped to see some on the journey, but I wound up not crossing paths with anyone though I evidently crossed paths with some of my Maryland friends near Macon or Moberly today.  Lots of fun caches to be had today!

It's not much of a long drive - but this had a nice back-country road element leading up to this little hidden (yet not so hidden) spot.  Found quickly.  TFTC.</groundspeak:text>

twilight rabbit I found your cache K105.5 (GC1HEBE) on 12/07/2013 at 9:30. This is my find #1259 since starting caching on 9/8/10. Found with my Oregon 550 &amp; iPhone 4. Thanks for playing this game and placing this cache. This was my find number 3 of the day. 

All is well with K105.5.

VERY good ("play on Words OR letters").. 
We're on our way home to see what's happening.. We need to be home, and prepare for the Veteran's 4th Annual, Lighted Christmas Parade, in Vinton, IA., the Thursday evening (6 PM)(it's DARK), before Thanksgiving.. (The VFW and AmVets got this Parade started four years ago).. Our Veterans Foreign Wars (VFW), American Veterans (AmVets), American Legion, and Vinton's Vol. Fire Dept., all get together for this Parade.. LOTS of business owners put in their lighted "floats", etc. Really a VERY Pretty Parade, with all the Christmas lighted entries.. We even have some antique cars and trucks, in the parade.....
BTW, we want to THANK YOU, for your Cache(s) and maybe one day we'll BCNU down the road..

   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This cache is part of the Peanuts Gang series in Rothwell Park and Lion's Beuth park. I have chosen the area because there is many areas you can park and still get to more than one cache by walking and then can get back into your vehicle and park again to get the next set of caches. You can also if you want walk or bike the nice trails in the area to get to most of the caches. There are also many things to do in the park, plan to bring the family and stay for more enjoyment after your cache adventure that will take you to many areas of the park including around the lake which will give you good views. If you do bring your kids please watch them when around vehicle used areas and the lake caches are not next to the water and you will have several feet if they get away from you. Most to all the cache should not take long to find depending on your expertise.V1p3rx and I have worked to make the series fun and not finding the same old thing over and over. You will find a couple different styles of hides and also one that is maybe not be the expected way to retrieve the cache from the rest of the series. Stealth may be required due to being close to trails, or areas people may visit. We have attempted to give you geocover in all areas but it is a park. Please make sure the cache is hidden well when you place it back into its hiding spot. There is a archery range in the area so use caution even though caches are not placed in the area of the archery. Hope you enjoy the area and caches available in the park and this series.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charles (Sparky) Monroe Schulz was born on November 22nd, 1922 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, but grow up in St. Paul Minnesota at the age of 77 he passed away on February 12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 2000 in Santa Rosa, California. Schulz first comic strip was called &lt;em&gt;Li’l Folks and ran from June 1947-January 1950 in the&lt;/em&gt; St. Paul Pioneer Press. In Li’l Folks was the first time Schulz used the name Charlie Brown and he created a dog that also looked much like Snoopy. In May of 1948 Schulz sold the first of his one panel drawing to The Saturday Evening Post. After his Li’l Folks comic strip was dropped in the 1950’s, Schulz went to United Feature Syndicated with the one panel Li’I Folks. Interested in his one panel comic, However Schulz had developed a normal four panel strip and at that time and United Feature Syndicated became interested and decided to publish a four panel comic. Peanuts made its debut on October 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt;, 1950, in seven different newspapers. The popular weekly Sunday page made its first appearance on January 6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 1952. When the Peanuts comic strip was on top, it was published every day in 2,600 papers in 75 countries, 21 languages. In almost 50 years the Peanuts comic strip was produced Schulz drew nearly 18,000 strips. Between the comic strips, merchandise, product endorsement produced revenues of more than 1 billion per year. Schulz’s estimated earrings was 30-40 million annually. The Peanuts comic strip only once why Schulz was alive had reshowings when Schulz went on vacation for five-weeks to celebrate his 75&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; birthday. Schulz never had assistants creating the strip and refused to hire an inker or letterer. On December 14&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; 1999 Schulz announced his retirement due to having several small strokes and a blocked aorta. It was later discovered he had colon cancer that had metastasized. Once Schulz started chemotherapy he was unable to see clearly. Schulz on February 12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 2000 died in his sleep around 9:45 P.M. from colon cancer. The last original Peanuts comic strip was produced the next day on Sunday, February 13&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;. Charles Monroe Schulz is buried in Pleasant Hill Cemetery in Sebastopol, California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lucy Van Pelt-First appeared on March 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt;, 1952 in comic strip and she made her last appearance on December 13&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 1999 in comic strip. Lucy is the oldest of 3 she has two brothers Linus and Rerun. Lucy was the third Peanuts character created behind Violet and Schroeder. She was often seen in her psychiatry booth with the sign of the doctor is in on the bottom part of the booth.  Lucy wore a blue dress with black and white shoes, until the 1970 when Schulz started creating the female charters in pants and shirts to keep them more contemporary, by 1980 it was a permanent look.   Lucy is said to be named after a neighbor of Schulz, Louann van Pelt in Colorado Springs, and modeled after Schulz first wife Joyce. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Geocaching please respect and follow the rules of the park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Park is open to the public daily from 5:00 a.m.-11:00 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not damage any of the parks property, tress, or other wildlife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope you enjoy the park and its amenities.  &lt;/p&gt;

Photography waned as the pastels and darker hues of sunset faded into the clouds above.  It was time to call the day complete.  My journey around Mark Twain Lake had been a lot of fun and memorable.  Now all that remained was the drive home.  Knowing that there were some new caches in the Moberly area, I opted to take the longer route.

Arriving at the park, I was greeted by multi-colored lights announcing "Season's Greetings".  The entire park appeared to be lit up for the festivities!  How cool!  I parked close to the entrance and set upon the task at hand.  An initial miscalculation led to some backtracking.  Once at the coordinates, the cache was easily found, signed and replaced.  The theme immediately hit home, and I looked forward to discovering some familiar friends in the area.  [;)]</groundspeak:text>

I was sitting at home doing not much of anything, when all of a sudden my email pinged. New cache! I hurriedly looked to see where it was, and wouldn't you know it? It was in the place I was in very recently...Moberly! Well, not long after, my email pinged again. Another in Moberly! It pinged again...and again...and AGAIN! All told, I saw eight caches pop up! 

There was no way I was going to let them slide, so I messaged dphickey and asked him if he wanted to go on an epic FTF run with me. At first he said he couldn't go. I knew I was going anyway, so I told him I'd check as I got closer to Columbia. Sure enough, when I got close to town, he said he was able and ready to go! I picked him up and we took off north to Moberly!

This was the third cache of the evening. After suffing the sting of defeat on the previous cache, we set our sights on this one. We parked the car and walked toward the cache, seeing the probable hiding spot in the distance. Our suspicions were correct and we had cache in hand quickly. I put everything back and we headed back to the car. Just as we got back, I realized that I had left my flashlight at ground zero! Trudging back, I retrieved the flashlight and headed back to the car again. Off to the next cache!

FTF-2 DNF-1

Thanks for the fun cache! TNLN/SL TFTC!

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Co-FTF with Arthur and Trillian.    After 1 FTF and 1 DNF we zipped around the park to park nearby this cache.   Once we left the car it was pretty obvious where the cache would be.   Once again A&amp;T beat me to the cache with his quick strides and log was in hand.  We signed the cache and replaced and made our way back to the car only to find that a flashlight was left at GZ.  Backtracking and another quick find remedied that situation and we were off to the next cache.  TFTC</groundspeak:text>

For no good reason at all… this one took us a few minutes to find. It was right where you'd expect it to be… but we were busy looking in other places you'd expect it to be. Finally… it was found and we put our "SLAGA 3" signature on the log. Thanks for a find we made harder than we should have… and for the new county on my map, twilight rabbit!</groundspeak:text>

Kids ran almost all the way out there (and went to bed early tonight, thank you!).  The box was HARD to open!  We took a lizard, a car and a bouncy ball and left a valentine's pencil (yes, Happy V-day!), a car, and an Indian.  This was a great cache full of fun stuff for the kids.

This was our first Chariton County find.  The nearby pond is mostly dried up.  We will have to come back when it warms (although it was a lovely Indian summer day) to find some of the reptiles and amphibians that hang out here.  Lots of osage oranges littering the ground in the park.  Thanks for bringing us to this interesting park!</groundspeak:text>

Caching won.... found 15 and had two DNFs and didn't even try for the last four on my list as it was getting dark and I had been up 24.5 hours by then.

Took the long way then ended bushwhacking to get to GZ.  Found container mostly uncovered.  SL TN then tried to cover it up as best as I could.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Seventh of 11 finds on a long day making a circle thru 5 counties in mid-Missouri.  Since I don't know the area, I tried to approach the cache from the wrong road but quickly realized my mistake and went thru the park.  The park was empty and I had a nice walk thru the woods to the cache.  While walking, my wife called from Columbia where it had been raining and thundering all morning.  I was enjoying a rather nice day without a sign of any storms.  I made the easy find and continued on, enjoying the day even more.  Thanks for putting this cache out.</groundspeak:text>

After misreading the map and pulling in one driveway too soon… I got things straightened out and pulled in and parked not very far at all from ground zero. I walked up to it and saw the cache right away. We signed our group (for the day) "SLAGA 3" signature and headed on down the road.

In Odessa, Mo. for non-geocaching affairs last night, we decided to make the most of it and stayed the night in Blue Springs to launch from there. We are looking forward to spending what looks to be a beautiful Spring Sunday caching across a new section of Missouri for us. We hope to light up 12 new Missouri counties while breaking our daily county record, adding a few others along the way.

Caching won.... found 15 and had two DNFs and didn't even try for the last four on my list as it was getting dark and I had been up 24.5 hours by then.

After the rain of the past few nights/days, the log is soaked and the baggie did not help.  The baggie and the cache container needs to be placed "upside down" the end that opens on both should be pointing down, to help keep the water out.  I didn't have anything to replace the log so it could use some TLC.  Made a mark  I think...

Nice easy parking for my Mini Winnie. Easy to identify the hiding spot and make the find. The day was starting to get longer than I expected and I don't think I will get as far as I planned.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">What to do when you have a weekend to yourself?  Go caching of course.  I loaded up the geodogs and went on a 1300-mile roadtrip to Kansas City and back.  I had to primary goals for this trip: Find the KCI geoart and complete the Iowa County Seat Challenge on the way home.  I had a secondary goal of finding a few new counties in Missouri and Kansas.  I am happy to report I was successful.  Along the way I kept an eye out for ghost caches, high favorite points, and challenges.  I got a good tour of the KC metro area on this trip.  Always nice to see the off the beaten path stops.  I even managed to get eight icons on Saturday.  I am sure that will help me with a challenge somewhere along the route.  Thanks for the hospitality.  I pulled in to town to get a second cache in this county.  Lucky for me the wasp were gone.  XNSL TFTC</groundspeak:text>

As I pulled up and surveyed he area, I knew where it had to be but took a few minutes of pretending to sight see to make sure I wasn't being watched from the nearby cars.   Once I got to GZ, it was an easy find.  I was happy to spot it quickly since it was middle of the day and several cars parked near-by, but I didn't spot one one person in the brief time I was here.

9 of 42 that I found today. 
Went out caching today with the intention of finding my 10,000th cache, and once that goal was accomplished, I just kept caching my way north until the thought of beer brought me back home...

Had to outwait a couple of muggles talking in the driveway next to the church but eventually they moved on and I could swoop in for the cache. Made quick work of signing the log and replacing the cache and it was just in time as one of the guys returned right after I got back in my car. TNLNSL. Thanks for the cache!</groundspeak:text>

In Odessa, Mo. for non-geocaching affairs last night, we decided to make the most of it and stayed the night in Blue Springs to launch from there. We are looking forward to spending what looks to be a beautiful Spring Sunday caching across a new section of Missouri for us. We hope to light up 12 new Missouri counties while breaking our daily county record, adding a few others along the way.

Even though the quest for the day was fulfilled, stretching a bit to the west from Moberly wasn't out of the question!  The drive was a bit slow until enough open road was available to pass an 18-wheeler.  Quite a few of them were spotted on the drive over.  Eventually, I found myself parking downtown in the middle of the road as per the lines drawn there.  A quick jog to the coordinates and search brought forth the cache container.  Once signed and back in place, a nearby statue was investigated a bit before a pressing need to find the next cache and move on entered my mind.  Thanks for pointing out this bit of local history!</groundspeak:text>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cache Across America Series:&lt;/strong&gt; This is a series of caches that will take you on a caching tour of the entire United States. One cache is hidden in each of the 50 states. These caches each contain a numeric clue that will lead you to &lt;a href="http://www.geocaching.com/bookmarks/view.aspx?guid=68e2d17a-8ae9-45c9-9516-0e45694cc2d7"&gt;one final cache&lt;/a&gt; located in our nation's capitol upon completion of the series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td height="61" bgcolor="#FFFFFF"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About this cache:&lt;/strong&gt; Missouri is the home of many influential people and places.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
From the trading post in St Louis to the Garment District in Kansas City, Missouri was a major center of trade. The Garment District was second only to New York City in number of clothing manufacturers in the 1930's. The Kansas City stockyards routed 2,631,808 cattle through its yards in 1923, in addition to hogs, mules and horses, making it second only the the Chicago yards in number of transactions. St Louis was founded in 1764 by Pierre Laclède Liguest and for many years was the center of trade for the states along the Mississippi and Missouri rivers. These two rivers have a combined basin of 689,000 square miles encompassing almost 42% of the land area of the coterminous United States. Missouri is also famous for it’s Missouri Foxtrotters,(a fine mule) and it has been a major supplier of mules to the USA and foreign countries for over 150 years.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Many famous people have called Missouri home including Jesse James,Daniel Boone, Harry Truman,George Washington Carver, Samuel Clemens, Laura Ingles Wilder, Maya Angelou,Satchel Paige, John "Buck" O’Neil,J.C. Penny, Scott Joplin,General John J. Pershing, General Omar N. Bradley and my personal favorite Walter Elias Disney.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After spending several months trying to find a place that best exemplified Missouri I decided that this site was the most fitting. Walt moved to Marceline at the age of four and this was very influential in his design of Disneyland. When he was designing Main Street USA he and his designers used the main street of Marceline as a model. Walt once said "To tell the truth, more things of importance happened to me in Marceline than ever happened since--or are likely to in the future."&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cache is on private property but it is open to the public. There is parking due south of the cache that is very well marked. Also make sure you check the sign to the east of the parking lot in front of the house for more fun facts.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Please only do this cache during daylight hours as I have told the owner we would not be out after dark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td height="61" bgcolor="#CCCCCC"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logging Requirements:&lt;/strong&gt; Enjoy this cache as you would any other. If you are searching this cache as a participant in the Cache Across America series, please post a photo of yourself or a member of your group with the cache in your online log. If you for some reason are unable to meet the photo requirement, please make alternate arrangements to verify your find with the individual cache owner. There is no photo requirement for non-challenge participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individual verification of all 50 state finds will be required before logging the series final.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If participating in the series, please take note of the three digit code located inside this cache. Save this code in a secure place. When you have visited all 50 caches, and have collected all 50 codes, you are welcome to seek and find the final cache! Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Came to Marceline to visit the museum and planned on finding this cache on my way out of town. Then I was walking back to the car after visiting a POI and realized, "I think this might be the part of town where I had seen the cache on the map." I pulled up the app and my suspicion was correct....I had already visited GZ. I told the wife and kids that they could stay in the car if they want, but I'm going to make the trek back to go get it. It was a quick/easy find, but well hidden from Muggles. Since I didn't have my caching bag with me, I traded my favorite inkpen for the Cinderella Necklace. This cache is in such a historically magical place. Glad I had the idea to check my brain map.</groundspeak:text>

I loaded up the road bike and joined over 400 other crazy cyclists to ride across the beautiful state of Missouri in the Big BAM (Bike Across Missouri). We picked the hottest time of the year because we rode in over 100 degrees heat index. But that did not stop me from finding several great caches! I had the GPSr loaded up for each overnight town and for the route I would be riding. 

Just logging one not all 50 states [:D]

Interesting location. I stopped to look around for a bit before continuing on my journey.

About a month ago I found this and knew it was gunna be an awesome find. We where looking around the Columbia area because of an event there, today. That's when I spotted this one :)

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">CAA # 37 for us and our 1st MO cache! Loved, loved, loved this one! Amazing to think of all the dreaming that took place here.  The barn is wonderful and we enjoyed taking a tour of Marceline after visiting GZ.  We had a bit of trouble finding the cache due to the frozen snow but we soon realized there was a tool nearby which we could use. Took the required pics, noted the code and traded trackables. Took the only one that was in the container and dropped off our Cache Across America #12 U.S. Flag Micro Geocoin and the another travel tag that wants to visit places where dreams take place (perfect location here!).

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I had no idea that Walt was from here. Wow! Perfect placement of a CAA cache to commemorate one of the greatest American legends, right in America's heartland. The signs are great and really help understand a lot of Walt's work.

As for the cache itself... I immediately located what clearly appeared to be its hiding place, but no cache. Oh no, did I come here in vain? Others had reported finding the cache quite a bit away from GZ, so I did the same and eventually found it. But the place where I found it was neither a good hiding spot, nor near GZ, and it didn't match the hint either. It must have been moved there by a muggle. So after finding and logging I placed the cache in its natural and most likely location. Also dropped a TB.</groundspeak:text>

I had to primary goals for this trip: Find the KCI geoart and complete the Iowa County Seat Challenge on the way home.  I had a secondary goal of finding a few new counties in Missouri and Kansas.  I am happy to report I was successful.  Along the way I kept an eye out for ghost caches, high favorite points, and challenges.  I got a good tour of the KC metro area on this trip.  Always nice to see the off the beaten path stops.  I even managed to get eight icons on Saturday.  I am sure that will help me with a challenge somewhere along the route.  Thanks for the hospitality.  I was excited to see this one ended up on my route.  That sealed the deal for me.  I have been slowly collecting these.  It was a nice stroll out to Walt Disney's building.  I read the plaques and learned a little bit.  Only down side was one of the geodogs found something very disguisting to roll in.  Had to drive with the windows down after that.  XNSL TFTC</groundspeak:text>

Flew in today from Reno, NV for a business trip to Kansas City (KS).  Knowing that my training will start tomorrow and this cache is only two hours away (or so)...but one way...well ok, when am I going to be back in this area again?  So...here I drive, fighing off GIGANTIC Grasshoppers and wondering what in the world is making all that noise in the trees (it's quite in Nevada - - except the occasional Rattlesnake).  I was tickled pink when I drove up.  What a gorgeous area.  I had a couple of travel bugs ready to drop off.  I scurried through the beautiful area, glad that the family that was touring was about to leave. WHAT?  I can't find it?  NO WAY...I couldn't have drove that far and NOT find this cache!  Ok...I'll start searching photos.  Then I read the last log by DuneBuddy.  Hey, his picture doesn't match where I was.  My phone was taking me to the backside.  Once I looked at the photo, I too walked right up to the cache.  Got my number, stamped the log.  Discovered ONE travel bug inside and dropped off two.  The third one won't fit, so I'll save that one for the next cache.  I will post my photo when I get home and I'm not on my work computer [:)] Thank you for bringing me to such a fantastic place.  Getting a FAV point from the NV Jackson's!!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I made a detour on our cross country trip to make this find. Imagine my disappointment when we reached the GZ and could not find the cache. We drove to the nearby Sonic for a potty break and to get into an area where I had 4G to look at the photos to see if I could get any hints. I also desperately messaged the CO to see if by chance I could get a response to my desperate call for help. We drove back to GZ and noticing one of the location of the photos was not where I would have expected it to be, I went to that location and walked right up to the cache. I found the cache about 10 meters from where my GPS said it would be.

This is a great place. We were expecting a commercialized spot with lots of mouse eared items for sale, but we had it to ourselves and could enjoy the peaceful setting. It's a great place to bring your picnic lunch and relax. TFTC</groundspeak:text>

This makes our EIGHTH CAA for this trip out west..... We are tuckered out and headed home... I will get terryn4iy to log his finds sometime next week....
We geocached all the way out to Seattle to witness our son marrying the perfect girl! An exciting trip to a wonderful event. Thank you CO for this cache series .... We really enjoyed the places you picked... Especially surprised by the Michigan cache ... We would have never found McCourtys ( did I spell that right?) park on our own but loved it..... And the Bruneau Overlook in Idaho OMGOsh! We had been to the Bruneau Dunes before and we were really excited to find that overlook... A little hard on our travel van though.   And we loved camping at Atherton Creek in Wyoming after finding that cache! Thank you for all the fun ... God Bless!

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Fairly quick find on a very pleasant day while passing through on the way to somewhere else, sans geo-pups Zoe and Daisy.
We were on our way from Kansas City back to Ohio and chose this route hoping for less traffic and less road construction than I-70. 
We were pleasantly surprised by the road less traveled and the various attractions along the way. However, we were pressed for time and we limited our stops to things that really caught our eye.
This cache was a bonus of sorts, because we stopped here to see the site and sign the barn beam, then checked for caches as an afterthought and were surprised to find we were on top of one.
The fact that it was a Cache Across America was even better, and we quickly had it in hand and the log signing ceremony ensued.
And a good time was had by all :-)

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Find #10000 @ 8:43:00 AM. 

10 of 42 that I found today. 
Went out caching today with the intention of finding my 10,000th cache, and once that goal was accomplished, I just kept caching my way north until the thought of beer brought me back home...

I had no Idea when I found my first geocache 10 years ago that someday, I would wind up with over 10,000 cache finds, cache in 32 states and 2 Canadian Provinces, make many new friends, and have al ot of fun doing this. I cant wait to see what the future holds. I enjoyed wandering around the grounds, reflecting of the setting and the moment.

We have been meaning to stop by this cache for a long time, but was always in to much of a hurry to get to some destination.  So glad we finally had the time to check this cool sight out.  Once again Geocaching has taken me to a cool sight that I never would have found without it.  Thanks</groundspeak:text>

 In Odessa, Mo. for non-geocaching affairs last night, we decided to make the most of it and stayed the night in Blue Springs to launch from there. We are looking forward to spending what looks to be a beautiful Spring Sunday caching across a new section of Missouri for us. We hope to light up 12 new Missouri counties while breaking our daily county record, adding a few others along the way.
Up at the ear-lobes of dawn....not burning daylight today! 
This was a wonderful stop for us...We loved walking these grounds discussing Walt Disney and how he changed the World for all of us.
We took lots of photos and left our personal mark in the barn....
We left a very special TB for a very special little girl who's love of art was no doubt somehow influenced by the Legacy Disney left behind.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">What a moving cache.  We strolled out to GZ on this great summer day.  The bug were making a lot of noise and it felt like we were moving backwards in time, back to a simpler days.  I can see how a person could get lost in their dreams out here.

We are out here from Seattle to pick us a few more states and to finish up the Jasmer challenge.  We just started the Cache Across America series ( this is our third one)  just as we are picking up the last four of the continental states that we need.  We will he Hawaii next year and we will be done with all the states.   As my wife says, so we are going to start over to get the CAA caches now?  Yep.  I guess we are kinda crazy.

Found @ 1:51:00 PM. Thanks for the hunt.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">First cache owners, I apologize for the cut and paste, but I'm logging 600 caches, and try as I can, I just can't remember them all. This one I will definitely remember, and when people ask about the trip, I give this as an example of what geocaching is all about. Getting a favorite from this girl. . 

To the tune of Gilligan's Island

Just sit right back 
And you'll hear a tale
A tale of a caching trip.
That started with an airplane trip.
Across the great Midwest
The goal was quality caches
Across the great midwest
Four caching friends set out one day
For ten caching days, 
For ten caching days.


The airplane landed in Denver
The caching crew were stoked.
If not for the planning of Nick and Jeff
We might have slept too much
We might have slept too much


The group had lots of goals
And lots of miles to drive.
With wherigos
Letter boxes
Some virtuals
And webcams
Traditionals
Some multis and earth caches
All during this great trip.




Included in this caching trip
Were lots of counties and states
And Cache Across America
And old ones as we could.


We worked on many challenges
We cached all through the night.
To make sure all our goals were met
We slept and ate while in the car.


No kids, no work, no comfy beds
Well sleep when we get home.
Like addicted cachers 
We explored our great country.


So thanks to all the cache owners
For hiding these to find
From catchers from Jacksonville.
We appreciate your hides.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">My second CCA cache.

This cache was found as part of a nine day four thousand mile caching trip through the upper Midwest and Canada. magtfplanner, InxtricablFate, memomls and I flew in to Denver from Jacksonville, FL and rented a car. We then traveled through eleven states and two Canadian provinces finding a cache in each county and DeLorome page we passed through. We also visited several important sites like Mount Rushmore, the wind caves and several state capitals while stopping for as many non-traditional caches as possible along the way.

In the end we found two Wherigos, six web-cams, seven multis, twenty three letter boxes, twenty eight earth, forty four virtuals, eighty eight mystery, and three hundred ninety five traditionals for a total count of five hundred ninety three caches. Included in those were eight Cache Across America caches, three “oldest in the state” caches (with Kansas’s Mingo also being the oldest active cache in the world), two sword in the stone caches, and a bunch more that took us to places we would never have gone without caching.

We all had a great time and very little sleep. We found a ton of caches and made some fantastic memories. Thanks to all of the cache owners for placing and maintaining all of these great caches for us to find.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Today I set out on the first days of epic caching for the Jesse James Cache Bash! I started my day out rather early, but I was rip rarin' to go! I initially had to deal with some rain, but it all cleared up very quickly by the time I got to my first cache. I got a lot of caches today, to say the very least. No matter how many I got today, I had an awesome time just being outdoors and enjoying the weather. This was one of the ones I found, and it helped to create a great experience.

This cache was the 4th of 113 total caches on the day. TNLN/SL Thanks, bsabrook41, for placing this cache and for the fun!

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Found by Mary &amp; David, from Melbourne, Australia, at 1310. So dry and dusty, and not a drop of water in the creek. We tour some southern States next month, and Mary is looking forward to tasting the real thing. We weren't watching the pointer closely enough. David thought he spotted the cache but it turned out to be a wasp nest and he was stung on the finger. Found the cache shortly after though. Curious that this is the third "J" road we drove on the get here. Our thanks to bsabrook41.</groundspeak:text>

This was the rallying cry when I heard that there was going to be an AWESOME Mega Event in the Omaha, Nebraska, area! Now, I don't know about you, but to be able to head to a really great caching area to attend a Mega is a pretty awesome situation!

So, I made my plans. I knew I was going to drive across Missouri, up to Iowa and over to Nebraska, of course! So I planned...and planned...and planned. I plotted routes, I took caches into consideration. I decided to mainly focus on Earthcaches and Virtuals, but I certainly added others to the mix. If I was going to go on a road trip, I was going to make it fun!

This was day one of the adventure. It found me beginning at home in Fulton, caching my way along US 36 to St. Joseph and on up to Council Bluffs and finally the Omaha area. I had a lot of fun, that's for sure! My sights were originally set on stopping in St. Jo, but I got done with my route so quickly that I said to heck with it...I'd push on to Omaha!

Naturally, along the way I did some caching, and boy was it fun!

If there were answers to be sent, they have been sent. Pics will be uploaded where necessary. [;)]

This cache was the 3rd cache of 69 caches on the day. Thanks for placing this cache for myself and others to enjoy! TNLN/SL TFTC!

Yes, we know where our towels are...

Day 2 of my Midwest Journey to Geowoodstock XII from Des Moines, IA.  Today I started in Ottumwa, IA with some foggy weather and got into some rather stormy conditions as I made my way into Missouri.  Eventually I punched through a line of thunderstorms while moving west from Edina to Kirksville.  The rest of the day was quite delightful and the weather kept getting better and better before ending in Columbia, MO.  Most of my good friends going to GWS were well on their way to the event and I had hoped to see some on the journey, but I wound up not crossing paths with anyone though I evidently crossed paths with some of my Maryland friends near Macon or Moberly today.  Lots of fun caches to be had today!

My Nuvi had tried to route me via a rather interesting way to get to this cache, but gladly ignored it as it seemed a better way that didn't involve driving down mysterious non-existent roads and across airport runways was to be had.  Sure enough I got there no problem on my own.  Quick find.  TFTC.</groundspeak:text>

Glad we came this way on our way up as our GPS COULD NOT find some of the others in the area due to various road constructions in the past - she didn't know about the new road.  Nice hide.

Day 2 of my Midwest Journey to Geowoodstock XII from Des Moines, IA.  Today I started in Ottumwa, IA with some foggy weather and got into some rather stormy conditions as I made my way into Missouri.  Eventually I punched through a line of thunderstorms while moving west from Edina to Kirksville.  The rest of the day was quite delightful and the weather kept getting better and better before ending in Columbia, MO.  Most of my good friends going to GWS were well on their way to the event and I had hoped to see some on the journey, but I wound up not crossing paths with anyone though I evidently crossed paths with some of my Maryland friends near Macon or Moberly today.  Lots of fun caches to be had today!

The Beta Band was playing on the radio as I rolled up on this cache.  I had great anticipation of seeing other cachers by about this point, but had not seen any.  The road was a little rough, but nothing my standard car couldn't handle.  Quick find.  TFTC.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Today I set out on the first days of epic caching for the Jesse James Cache Bash! I started my day out rather early, but I was rip rarin' to go! I initially had to deal with some rain, but it all cleared up very quickly by the time I got to my first cache. I got a lot of caches today, to say the very least. No matter how many I got today, I had an awesome time just being outdoors and enjoying the weather. This was one of the ones I found, and it helped to create a great experience.

This cache was the 3rd of 113 total caches on the day. TNLN/SL Thanks, 123brimxyz, for placing this cache and for the fun!

I loaded up the road bike and joined over 400 other crazy cyclists to ride across the beautiful state of Missouri in the Big BAM (Bike Across Missouri). We picked the hottest time of the year because we rode in over 100 degrees heat index. But that did not stop me from finding several great caches! I had the GPSr loaded up for each overnight town and for the route I would be riding.

This was the rallying cry when I heard that there was going to be an AWESOME Mega Event in the Omaha, Nebraska, area! Now, I don't know about you, but to be able to head to a really great caching area to attend a Mega is a pretty awesome situation!

So, I made my plans. I knew I was going to drive across Missouri, up to Iowa and over to Nebraska, of course! So I planned...and planned...and planned. I plotted routes, I took caches into consideration. I decided to mainly focus on Earthcaches and Virtuals, but I certainly added others to the mix. If I was going to go on a road trip, I was going to make it fun!

This was day one of the adventure. It found me beginning at home in Fulton, caching my way along US 36 to St. Joseph and on up to Council Bluffs and finally the Omaha area. I had a lot of fun, that's for sure! My sights were originally set on stopping in St. Jo, but I got done with my route so quickly that I said to heck with it...I'd push on to Omaha!

Naturally, along the way I did some caching, and boy was it fun!

If there were answers to be sent, they have been sent. Pics will be uploaded where necessary. [;)]

This cache was the 4th cache of 69 caches on the day. Thanks for placing this cache for myself and others to enjoy! TNLN/SL TFTC!

Yes, we know where our towels are...

A first for Brookfield, I hope that we can get more in this fine city.  

Looking around it feels that someone in a wheelchair should be able to get to this one.  Pavement all the way, no need to leave the pavement at all.

I had to replace this.  IF you find a pill bottle that is orange, you found the OLD ONE.  The new one is a pill bottle that is covered in camo duct tape.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">This was my 25th find for a total of 44 for this outing. 

I loaded up the road bike and joined over 400 other crazy cyclists to ride across the beautiful state of Missouri in the Big BAM (Bike Across Missouri). We picked the hottest time of the year because we rode in over 100 degrees heat index. But that did not stop me from finding several great caches! I had the GPSr loaded up for each overnight town and for the route I would be riding. 

Thanx for placing this cache for me to find JackieA0818!</groundspeak:text>

Was in the area with Cribbage Witch - On our frequent route from St. Louis to St Joseph Area and back through KC to visit with the Folks in Maysville and the kids in KC.  This time we didnt do the KC leg but instead headed back across the state using 36 to Hannibal and down.  We decided to pick up a few caches to give ourselves time to stretch. Even though the trip was about double the length, Geocaching seemed to make it feel it went twice as fast. This was one we found on the return trip...Thanks for putting these out to make our trip more enjoyable today.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">What to do when you have a weekend to yourself?  Go caching of course.  I loaded up the geodogs and went on a 1300-mile roadtrip to Kansas City and back.  I had to primary goals for this trip: Find the KCI geoart and complete the Iowa County Seat Challenge on the way home.  I had a secondary goal of finding a few new counties in Missouri and Kansas.  I am happy to report I was successful.  Along the way I kept an eye out for ghost caches, high favorite points, and challenges.  I got a good tour of the KC metro area on this trip.  Always nice to see the off the beaten path stops.  I even managed to get eight icons on Saturday.  I am sure that will help me with a challenge somewhere along the route.  Thanks for the hospitality.  This one is going to be a memorable one.  I found the cache quick enough and was just getting ready to drive off when the cops showed up.  Apparently one of the patrons thought I had planted a bomb.  I explained geocaching to everyone and showed them what I was up to.  All is good now.  XNSL TFTC</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Today I set out on the first days of epic caching for the Jesse James Cache Bash! I started my day out rather early, but I was rip rarin' to go! I initially had to deal with some rain, but it all cleared up very quickly by the time I got to my first cache. I got a lot of caches today, to say the very least. No matter how many I got today, I had an awesome time just being outdoors and enjoying the weather. This was one of the ones I found, and it helped to create a great experience.

This cache was the 8th of 113 total caches on the day. TNLN/SL Thanks, JackieA0818, for placing this cache and for the fun!

   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This is part of three caches, for Chip n Dale, placed in three towns,  LaClede, Wheeling and Brookfield.  Chip n Dale, were chipmunk cartoon characters, created in 1943, by Walt Disney Productions, and named after a famed, 18th century cabinet maker, Thomas Chippendale (per Wikipedia).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LaClede, is General John J. Pershing Boyhood Home State Historic Site.  It is very impressive and worth seeing while here.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a large coffee can , in camo tape, it contains swag, a first to find trophy, a pen and log.  There is parking nearby, and requires a short little walk, very minimal bush wacking. A very peaceful area, please respect the residents, and please be sure lid is on tight, to perserve the cache, and replace how you found it, to keep it hidden and safe from the elements.  Happy caching!&lt;/p&gt;
Congratulations to Seifertgal for being the First to Find!</groundspeak:long_description>

Was in the area with Cribbage Witch - On our frequent route from St. Louis to St Joseph Area and back through KC to visit with the Folks in Maysville and the kids in KC.  This time we didnt do the KC leg but instead headed back across the state using 36 to Hannibal and down.  We decided to pick up a few caches to give ourselves time to stretch. Even though the trip was about double the length, Geocaching seemed to make it feel it went twice as fast. This was one we found on the return trip...Thanks for putting these out to make our trip more enjoyable today.</groundspeak:text>

   <groundspeak:short_description html="False">This is one of four remaining covered bridges that have been preserved in Missouri.

Accessible from Sunrise to Sundown.</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">The Locust Creek Covered Bridge was built in 1868.  It is the longest of the four surviving covered bridges in Missouri at 151 feet long.  The bridge was built out of white pine using the Howe-truss system, utilizing vertical iron rods to draw the diagonal members tight against the top and bottom of the bridge.  It was situated on the main east-west road in northern Missouri, and served as a link over Locust Creek on America’s first transcontinental road. (Route 8)  In 1930, U. S. Highway 36 replaced Route 8, and after World War II, Locust Creek was channelized and straightened, so that it no longer flowed under the bridge.  Years of floods filled in the old riverbed with silt, which is why it appears that it is spanning an empty field.  In 1991, the bridge was raised six feet  to give it once again the appearance of a bridge and to protect it from wet ground below.

To log this cache, please email me with a basic explanation as to where in the bridge the structures shown in the pictures are located.  i.e. inside or outside the bridge, on the walls going up and down, across the ceiling, underneath the bridge, etc.</groundspeak:long_description>

I absolutely loved the covered bridge.  Favorite point from me!  I have always wanted to travel to Missouri's covered bridges and today it happened to work out.  The sign said temp closed but I was still able to get back there, as were many other people.  I think they had a recent hard rain that washed away some things, but I didn't have a problem.  It was a lovely time!  Email is on its way.  TFTC!!</groundspeak:text>

Sorry it's taken me so long to write this up. I sent the required info a while back, for myself and BlueBeadMan. It was such an awesome trip! We didn't mean for it to be a county run, but I did pick up some new ones. But I think the best was this virtual. I love covered bridges, especially when i can find a cache while getting photos of them! Our dogs enjoyed the hike as well, except for the walking bridge at the beginning. Thank you so much for bringing us to this beautiful spot.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">It almost seemed a bit silly to have detoured all the way out here for this cache as covered bridges are a very common sight back home, but I really can't resist the call of a good virtual.  It looks like the area has seen some fairly recent flooding and the approach in from parking was pretty washed out and extremely muddy.  I was glad to see that the bridge itself seemed to have weathered it all pretty well and I had little trouble gathering the info I needed before heading back to the car.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">What to do when you have a weekend to yourself?  Go caching of course.  I loaded up the geodogs and went on a 1300-mile roadtrip to Kansas City and back.  I had to primary goals for this trip: Find the KCI geoart and complete the Iowa County Seat Challenge on the way home.  I had a secondary goal of finding a few new counties in Missouri and Kansas.  I am happy to report I was successful.  Along the way I kept an eye out for ghost caches, high favorite points, and challenges.  I got a good tour of the KC metro area on this trip.  Always nice to see the off the beaten path stops.  I even managed to get eight icons on Saturday.  I am sure that will help me with a challenge somewhere along the route.  Thanks for the hospitality.  Another spot to get out and let the geodogs go for a run.  We walked out to the bridge and read the kiosk.  I explored the structure and gathered the necessary information.  Thanks for bringing me out here. TFTVC</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Caching my way up Highway 36 and west across Highway 61 from St. Louis to St. Joseph with Pastor G... trying to grab caches in as many counties as we could. I saw this virtual cache pop up on the map and told Pastor G (who was driving) about it. We both were pretty excited to go see a covered bridge... [b]especially[/b] if we could net a virtual cache in the process. What's more... it had a "24/7" attribute attached to it... something rather important since it was like 10:00 at night by this point in our trip.

So we headed down the gravel roads... winding this way and that 'til we got to the parking area for the covered bridge area. And as we pulled into the parking lot... we saw a sign indicating that the hours of visiting the bridge ended at sundown... not quite the "24/7" we had been hoping for.

I hope to get back here sometime when we can get to the bridge... but in the meantime... the cache page might should be updated to indicate that the cache isn't available 24/7. Thanks for keeping this virtual cache alive, Kiefer3D!</groundspeak:text>

My husband and I are on a mission to find all of the historic landmark covered bridges in the state and this is our third and by far our favorite.  I'm so pleased that they raised the bridge because it does appear more majestic than if it was seated on ground level....and now it's possible to go underneath and look at that structure too.  We found this using IPhone, but were unsure of what 'PICTURES' you were talking about, so I'll check online at home to see what we have to email you.  Thanks for bringing us here to this beautiful historic bridge and very nice hiking trail and conservation park area.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I had a great time on a road trip with Joe Friday and SWAG Dragon.  We left Thursday morning at 4:15 from Colorado and arrived at the hotel in St. Lewis MO 20 hours later.  Caching along the way always seams to make the time go by faster, but also adds 6 hours to the trip.  
We only found 100 caches total including all the events.  Every one of the caches was special for some reason.  I picked up 35+ new counties, several virtuals, larges, Earth caches, letterboxes, and a couple wherigos we even found about 50 waymarks, some benchmarks and some labs caches.  Some highlights of the trip were seeing the arch, seeing a flash mob broken up by police, SWAG Dragon falling flat into a ditch full of stinky water, being at our first Geowoodstock, and exploring some of the rich local history.  I enjoyed seeing some fellow Colorado cachers 1000 miles away.  The answers for the VCs, and ECs are being sent by Joe Friday, OneKindWord or Egnix.  Let me know if I need to sort through the pics and notes and answer myself. We used a group stamp most of the time. Thank you for placing this cache and keeping it going.  I am glad it was a part of the overall experience of going on a road trip to Geowoodstock.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">After an enjoyable time traveling around picking up new states for geocaching, attending homecoming at my alma mater, and seeing a bunch of new stuff to me, it is time to head home.  I stopped here just as the day was awakening.  It was 24 degrees outside and I had .25 miles to go as the crow flies, but I was determined to see this bridge. [:)]  

As I approached the parking area I scared up a buck.  I parked, put some socks and shoes on, took a swig of my warm coffee I had just bought, and headed out to this bridge.  I scared up a few more deers, saw a squirrel or two, and heard a lot of sounds in the quiet park in the early morning.  What a gem!  

Bridges of Madison County is, yes, one of my favorite movies, and though the color of the bridge isn't what I expected, or the lack of it being over water, it was a great stop on my way back to Wisconsin.

Sorry it's taken me so long to log these. This whole trip wasn't originally going to be a county run, but it turned out I picked up a few on the way. This one made me smile! I'd say the best three were the last three of the day. This whole trip wasn't originally going to be a county run, but it turned out I picked up a few on the way.

Was in the area with Cribbage Witch - On our frequent route from St. Louis to St Joseph Area and back through KC to visit with the Folks in Maysville and the kids in KC.  We decided to pick up a few caches to give ourselves time to stretch.    Even though the trip was about double the length, Geocaching seemed to make it feel it went twice as fast.    Thanks for putting these out to make our trip more enjoyable today.</groundspeak:text>

I then did not have time to stop and pick up anyway, was with a non cacher that had to get back to STL. Today when I pulled up my first thought was is it attached to the smile. with a quick search I found it and signed log. The bag was ripped some, I had a bag with me and replaced the old one, think it would have been ok but we need to keep this one in good shape for other. My favorite of the day TFTC</groundspeak:text>

This was the rallying cry when I heard that there was going to be an AWESOME Mega Event in the Omaha, Nebraska, area! Now, I don't know about you, but to be able to head to a really great caching area to attend a Mega is a pretty awesome situation!

So, I made my plans. I knew I was going to drive across Missouri, up to Iowa and over to Nebraska, of course! So I planned...and planned...and planned. I plotted routes, I took caches into consideration. I decided to mainly focus on Earthcaches and Virtuals, but I certainly added others to the mix. If I was going to go on a road trip, I was going to make it fun!

This was day one of the adventure. It found me beginning at home in Fulton, caching my way along US 36 to St. Joseph and on up to Council Bluffs and finally the Omaha area. I had a lot of fun, that's for sure! My sights were originally set on stopping in St. Jo, but I got done with my route so quickly that I said to heck with it...I'd push on to Omaha!

Naturally, along the way I did some caching, and boy was it fun!

If there were answers to be sent, they have been sent. Pics will be uploaded where necessary. [;)]

This cache was the 8th cache of 69 caches on the day. Thanks for placing this cache for myself and others to enjoy! TNLN/SL TFTC!

Yes, we know where our towels are...

Wheeling, LaClede and Brookfield.  The chipmunks, Chip and Dale are cartoon characters created in 1943, at Walt Disney Productions. They were named after a famed 18th century cabinet maker, Thomas Chippendale. (per Wikipedia) Wheeling, is the birthplace of Willis Allen "Bill" Glasgow (April 21, 1907 – November 1, 1959). His family moved when he was ten years old to Iowa, where he became a professional football player, winning many awards and using his NFL earnings, to further his education, becoming a lawyer, after his football days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a large container, wrapped in black tape, that contains swag, pen and log,  and a travel bug.  Great spot for more travel bugs to hide.  Lots of muggles, so please use stealth.  Be respectful of the residents and please be very careful of the lid and make sure it stays on tight, before replacing cache.  Replace, as you found it, so it will be kept hidden for the next find.  &lt;/p&gt;
Congratulations, Seifertgal for being the First to Find!</groundspeak:long_description>

Day 1 challenge complete. Still had time to hit the zoo in Omaha.  Amazing start to the vacation.

This was the rallying cry when I heard that Denver was hosting one of the greatest Mega events! Now, I don't know about you, but to be able to go to the event was reason enough to throw in my hat, but having it in Colorado would be incredibly epic!

So, I made my plans. I knew I was going to try to cover a bunch of states...why not?! So I planned...and planned...and planned. I plotted routes, I took caches into consideration. I decided to mainly focus on Earthcaches and Virtuals, but I certainly added others to the mix. If I was going to go on a road trip of a lifetime, I was going to make it fun!

Day One was more about getting miles under my belt than numbers of caches, so I only found a few along the way. 

If there were answers to be sent, they have been sent. Pics will be uploaded where necessary. Thanks for placing this cache for myself and others to enjoy! TNLN/SL TFTC!

Yes, we know where our towels are...

Was in the area with Cribbage Witch - On our frequent route from St. Louis to St Joseph Area and back through KC to visit with the Folks in Maysville and the kids in KC.  We decided to pick up a few caches to give ourselves time to stretch.    Even though the trip was about double the length, Geocaching seemed to make it feel it went twice as fast.    Thanks for putting these out to make our trip more enjoyable today.</groundspeak:text>

Score another for the wife -- she spotted it as quick as we pulled up - I thought she was "spoofing" me but there it was.   She complained  that  I had hid it better after signing, than when we pulled up - maybe not quite as viable, but still some what.

This was the rallying cry when I heard that there was going to be an AWESOME Mega Event in the Omaha, Nebraska, area! Now, I don't know about you, but to be able to head to a really great caching area to attend a Mega is a pretty awesome situation!

So, I made my plans. I knew I was going to drive across Missouri, up to Iowa and over to Nebraska, of course! So I planned...and planned...and planned. I plotted routes, I took caches into consideration. I decided to mainly focus on Earthcaches and Virtuals, but I certainly added others to the mix. If I was going to go on a road trip, I was going to make it fun!

This was day one of the adventure. It found me beginning at home in Fulton, caching my way along US 36 to St. Joseph and on up to Council Bluffs and finally the Omaha area. I had a lot of fun, that's for sure! My sights were originally set on stopping in St. Jo, but I got done with my route so quickly that I said to heck with it...I'd push on to Omaha!

Naturally, along the way I did some caching, and boy was it fun!

If there were answers to be sent, they have been sent. Pics will be uploaded where necessary. [;)]

This cache was the 6th cache of 69 caches on the day. Thanks for placing this cache for myself and others to enjoy! TNLN/SL TFTC!

Yes, we know where our towels are...

   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This is one of three caches for Chip n Dale, located in Brookfield, LaClede, and Wheeling.  Chipmunks, Chip n Dale, were cartoon characters, created in 1943, by Walt Disney Productions, named after a famed 18th century cabinet maker, Thomas Chippendale. (per Wikipedia).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brookfield's notable people were : A gospel singer and composer, Doris Akers, who lived in Brookfield until the age of five.  Jeff Roe, a Republican political consultant, who lived in Brookfield, until he joined the Army at age sixteen.  And the punk rock band All, lived in Brookfield from 1990 to 1994, when they released their albums Percolater (1992) and Breaking Things (1993).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brookfield is also home of the Great Pershing Balloon Derby, held every labor day weekend.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a pill bottle, which can hold small swag.  You will need to bring a pen.  Please make note of how you find it, so you can replace the same way,  so it won't get absorbed by its resting spot. Please be respectful of nearby residents. Some stealth is required.  There is a drive to pull into, to get you off the main road.  Happy caching.&lt;/p&gt;
Congratulations Seifertgal, for being the First to Find!</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">This was my 24th find for a total of 44 for this outing. 

I loaded up the road bike and joined over 400 other crazy cyclists to ride across the beautiful state of Missouri in the Big BAM (Bike Across Missouri). We picked the hottest time of the year because we rode in over 100 degrees heat index. But that did not stop me from finding several great caches! I had the GPSr loaded up for each overnight town and for the route I would be riding. 

Took the only TB in the cache. 

Thanx for placing this cache for me to find GmawCache!</groundspeak:text>

I loaded up the road bike and joined over 400 other crazy cyclists to ride across the beautiful state of Missouri in the Big BAM (Bike Across Missouri). We picked the hottest time of the year because we rode in over 100 degrees heat index. But that did not stop me from finding several great caches! I had the GPSr loaded up for each overnight town and for the route I would be riding. 

Thanx to the CO for a littel help not sure how I missed this one.

This was the rallying cry when I heard that there was going to be an AWESOME Mega Event in the Omaha, Nebraska, area! Now, I don't know about you, but to be able to head to a really great caching area to attend a Mega is a pretty awesome situation!

So, I made my plans. I knew I was going to drive across Missouri, up to Iowa and over to Nebraska, of course! So I planned...and planned...and planned. I plotted routes, I took caches into consideration. I decided to mainly focus on Earthcaches and Virtuals, but I certainly added others to the mix. If I was going to go on a road trip, I was going to make it fun!

This was day one of the adventure. It found me beginning at home in Fulton, caching my way along US 36 to St. Joseph and on up to Council Bluffs and finally the Omaha area. I had a lot of fun, that's for sure! My sights were originally set on stopping in St. Jo, but I got done with my route so quickly that I said to heck with it...I'd push on to Omaha!

Naturally, along the way I did some caching, and boy was it fun!

If there were answers to be sent, they have been sent. Pics will be uploaded where necessary. [;)]

This cache was the 7th cache of 69 caches on the day. Thanks for placing this cache for myself and others to enjoy! TNLN/SL TFTC!

Yes, we know where our towels are...

County: Linn, Missouri

Day 2 of my Midwest Journey to Geowoodstock XII from Des Moines, IA.  Today I started in Ottumwa, IA with some foggy weather and got into some rather stormy conditions as I made my way into Missouri.  Eventually I punched through a line of thunderstorms while moving west from Edina to Kirksville.  The rest of the day was quite delightful and the weather kept getting better and better before ending in Columbia, MO.  Most of my good friends going to GWS were well on their way to the event and I had hoped to see some on the journey, but I wound up not crossing paths with anyone though I evidently crossed paths with some of my Maryland friends near Macon or Moberly today.  Lots of fun caches to be had today!

Another case of the Nuvi thinking the access for the cache was too close to the main highway.  Resorted to my own routing algorithm to get to the old highway and found it without too much difficulty.  Lots of muggles drove practically with me to the cache as they were trying to get to the last houses on the road.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Today I set out on the first days of epic caching for the Jesse James Cache Bash! I started my day out rather early, but I was rip rarin' to go! I initially had to deal with some rain, but it all cleared up very quickly by the time I got to my first cache. I got a lot of caches today, to say the very least. No matter how many I got today, I had an awesome time just being outdoors and enjoying the weather. This was one of the ones I found, and it helped to create a great experience.

This cache was the 6th of 113 total caches on the day. TNLN/SL Thanks, 123brimxyz, for placing this cache and for the fun!

Maybe, 301 now.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a small cache, and  will need to bring a pen.  If you are traveling, this is a good area to get out and stretch your legs. Don't really have to worry about many muggles.  Please replace cache as you find it, so it won't fall to the ground, or disappear in its' host. Happy Caching!&lt;/p&gt;

This was find #29 of the day for us.
No Problems locating this cache quickly ... had to do a total tick check afterwards...
The logbook was missing so we put in a new one and fixed the container the best we could...

Was in the area with Cribbage Witch - On our frequent route from St. Louis to St Joseph Area and back through KC to visit with the Folks in Maysville and the kids in KC.  We decided to pick up a few caches to give ourselves time to stretch.    Even though the trip was about double the length, Geocaching seemed to make it feel it went twice as fast.    Thanks for putting these out to make our trip more enjoyable today.</groundspeak:text>

Cribbage witch mentioned that the container I  found appeared to be the original, Although I don't think it was in the correct spot and it was a REACH to get it.  Where I think was supposed to be - was filled with ants.

Was in the area with Cribbage Witch - On our frequent route from St. Louis to St Joseph Area and back through KC to visit with the Folks in Maysville and the kids in KC.  We decided to pick up a few caches to give ourselves time to stretch.    Even though the trip was about double the length, Geocaching seemed to make it feel it went twice as fast.    Thanks for putting these out to make our trip more enjoyable today.</groundspeak:text>

I'm sure it wasn't intentional, or maybe that super wasp was responsible, but the magnet was actually stuck to the i-beam inside the black bumper! That's a really strong magnet! We tried using the Nuvi's cable to lasso it...then I used my pen...then I used my hand (hoping no wasps were inside) and was able to flip it and pull it to daylight. For a log that was replaced 5 months ago, it's dry and crisp! Thanks for the challenge! We replaced it in it's likely intended location!</groundspeak:text>

Was in the area with Cribbage Witch - On our frequent route from St. Louis to St Joseph Area and back through KC to visit with the Folks in Maysville and the kids in KC.  We decided to pick up a few caches to give ourselves time to stretch.    Even though the trip was about double the length, Geocaching seemed to make it feel it went twice as fast.    Thanks for putting these out to make our trip more enjoyable today.</groundspeak:text>

Day 2 of my Midwest Journey to Geowoodstock XII from Des Moines, IA.  Today I started in Ottumwa, IA with some foggy weather and got into some rather stormy conditions as I made my way into Missouri.  Eventually I punched through a line of thunderstorms while moving west from Edina to Kirksville.  The rest of the day was quite delightful and the weather kept getting better and better before ending in Columbia, MO.  Most of my good friends going to GWS were well on their way to the event and I had hoped to see some on the journey, but I wound up not crossing paths with anyone though I evidently crossed paths with some of my Maryland friends near Macon or Moberly today.  Lots of fun caches to be had today!

Quick little highway stop on my way from Marceline to Colombia.  TFTC.</groundspeak:text>

Was in the area with Cribbage Witch - On our frequent route from St. Louis to St Joseph Area and back through KC to visit with the Folks in Maysville and the kids in KC.  We decided to pick up a few caches to give ourselves time to stretch.    Even though the trip was about double the length, Geocaching seemed to make it feel it went twice as fast.    Thanks for putting these out to make our trip more enjoyable today.</groundspeak:text>

Was in the area with Cribbage Witch - On our frequent route from St. Louis to St Joseph Area and back through KC to visit with the Folks in Maysville and the kids in KC.  We decided to pick up a few caches to give ourselves time to stretch.    Even though the trip was about double the length, Geocaching seemed to make it feel it went twice as fast.    Thanks for putting these out to make our trip more enjoyable today.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I had a great time on a road trip with Joe Friday and SWAG Dragon.  We left Thursday morning at 4:15 from Colorado and arrived at the hotel in St. Lewis MO 20 hours later.  Caching along the way always seams to make the time go by faster, but also adds 6 hours to the trip.  
We only found 100 caches total including all the events.  Every one of the caches was special for some reason.  I picked up 35+ new counties, several virtuals, larges, Earth caches, letterboxes, and a couple wherigos we even found about 50 waymarks, some benchmarks and some labs caches.  Some highlights of the trip were seeing the arch, seeing a flash mob broken up by police, SWAG Dragon falling flat into a ditch full of stinky water, being at our first Geowoodstock, and exploring some of the rich local history.  I enjoyed seeing some fellow Colorado cachers 1000 miles away.  The answers for the VCs, and ECs are being sent by Joe Friday, OneKindWord or Egnix.  Let me know if I need to sort through the pics and notes and answer myself. We used a group stamp most of the time. Thank you for placing this cache and keeping it going.  I am glad it was a part of the overall experience of going on a road trip to Geowoodstock.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Antique-nana decided that since I was off work for 2 weeks on shutdown that we should go for a drive &amp; pick up a few new caches &amp; maybe a county or two. I agreed thinking that I could do a few things around the house later in the week &amp; maybe have a couple days just for me the 2nd week. This was last Tuesday (7/8/14)! Little did I know that the counties she wanted to pick up were in Montana, South Dakota, Nebraska, Wyoming Colorado &amp; Kansas. So much for a short day trip &amp; getting a few things done around the house or a few days just for me! Ok, so it was really mostly my idea &amp; she just agreed to tag along as long as I let her try to find all the caches she possibly could !Here's how it really went:I am off work &amp; thought that since neither of us had ever been to North &amp; South Dakota or Montana and she had never been to most of the other states out this way it would be fun to go caching out here. We left last Tuesday &amp; are having a blast going places we have never been, seeing historic places &amp; just places that are different &amp; unusual. To make it even better we are finding all kinds of caches, meeting (unexpectedly) other cachers, trading bugs out, meeting &amp; talking to people we have never met &amp; will probably never meet again. This is what life is all about. I can hardly wait until I retire in another year or so. TN LN SL Thanks so much for making this trip fun with the cache you hid just for us to find!</groundspeak:text>

We were a little leary at first of going past the gate so we read the cache page and saw that we had the okay, WOW! We are so glad we made this cache a stop. Really enjoyed the cemetery, the stones and ornaments around them and took several pics. We have never seen a medal of honor on a monument before and this one was from the Civil War, very cool.  Loved that huge old, unfortunately dead tree.  So glad we stopped in to break up the highway monotony, we really enjoyed this one. Thanks for placing quest4adventure. Getting a favorite from us.

County: Macon, Missouri
Delorme Grid: MO-023

Day 2 of my Midwest Journey to Geowoodstock XII from Des Moines, IA.  Today I started in Ottumwa, IA with some foggy weather and got into some rather stormy conditions as I made my way into Missouri.  Eventually I punched through a line of thunderstorms while moving west from Edina to Kirksville.  The rest of the day was quite delightful and the weather kept getting better and better before ending in Columbia, MO.  Most of my good friends going to GWS were well on their way to the event and I had hoped to see some on the journey, but I wound up not crossing paths with anyone though I evidently crossed paths with some of my Maryland friends near Macon or Moberly today.  Lots of fun caches to be had today!

I wasn't sure of the path to the cache at first, thinking it was private property.  But I took a chance and it led me right back to Martha and the cache.  A large bird lost a significant battle along the pathway by the barn, and most of its carcass was right there and feathers were all over the path for a span of about 150 feet.

Took a moment to spot the cache, but it was in great shape!  TFTC.</groundspeak:text>

I initially had to deal with some rain, but it all cleared up very quickly by the time I got to my first cache. I got a lot of caches today, to say the very least. No matter how many I got today, I had an awesome time just being outdoors and enjoying the weather. This was one of the ones I found, and it helped to create a great experience.

This cache was the 1st of 113 total caches on the day. TNLN/SL Thanks, quest4adventure, for placing this cache and for the fun!

Atomic Goat's Breath and I approached the parking coordinates and decided to chance driving closer.  Goat deftly hopped out of the car and opened the gate for our passage.  It was a bumpy ride to be sure but not enough to deter us.  Once close to the area, we disembarked and carefully sought what we were after.  The find was quick as was the recording of our visit.  Thanks for pointing out this small patch of local history!  After a few photos, we returned from whence we came.

The City of Maples series The town of Macon was first settled by James T. Haley in 1852. However, long before Mr. Haley's arrival, scores of immigrants from Kentucky and Virginia ventured into the region as early as 1829. In 1872, John Beaumont donated 10,000 young maple trees Because of these 10,000 trees, Macon has been named "The City of Maples". The city have seven beautiful and well maintained parks and lakes.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>

&lt;p&gt;George Washington appointed the first engineer officers of the Army on June 16, 1775. Long Branch Dam was authorized by Congress in 1965 as a multi-purpose project for water supply, flood control, recreation, downstream water quality and fish/wildlife management. Construction began in 1973 and the dam was placed into operation in 1980. Thank to the rangers for your approval placing this cache&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Weather prediction was sunny and 50's for the day after Christmas.  I had not been out for a major cache run since July so I got permission from the muggle wife and our adventure was set.  We left before dawn and the plan was to return after sunset.  This was cache 16 for the day.  Signed log team TAD. TFTC.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">OCW dphickey and Tony Banks on what can only be described as a near-perfect day after Christmas! I am not gonna lie...we had a lot of fun, toured the northern reaches of our area and found some great caches. This is why I like caching...spending time with people, sharing common interests and a sense of adventure! What an awesome way to spend some time with awesome folks!

This cache was signed as TAD for our group. TNLN/SL Thanks, %OwnerName, for placing this cache and for the fun!

City of Maple 7  Rustic&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The City of Maples series The town of Macon was first settled by James T. Haley in 1852. However, long before Mr. Haley's arrival, scores of immigrants from Kentucky and Virginia ventured into the region as early as 1829. In 1872, John Beaumont donated 10,000 young maple trees Because of these 10,000 trees, Macon has been named "The City of Maples". The city have seven beautiful and well maintained parks and lakes&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;series 7 of 10 caches. will be in the city parks or around the lakes., around long branch lakes. and some somewhere in the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick nice family small town park. Great park jest have fun with family&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank to the City of Macon mo for your approval placing this cache&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

I loaded up the road bike and joined over 400 other crazy cyclists to ride across the beautiful state of Missouri in the Big BAM (Bike Across Missouri). We picked the hottest time of the year because we rode in over 100 degrees heat index. But that did not stop me from finding several great caches! I had the GPSr loaded up for each overnight town and for the route I would be riding.

I am not gonna lie...we had a lot of fun, toured the northern reaches of our area and found some great caches. This is why I like caching...spending time with people, sharing common interests and a sense of adventure! What an awesome way to spend some time with awesome folks!

Three men walking through a park wearing hoodies. Very suspicious. On our way back from the cache a guy who lived across from his porch called out to us a few times. When I finally acknowledged him, he asked what we were building. I called back that we were geocaching and kept on walking.

   <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;The City of Maples series The town of Macon was first settled by James T. Haley in 1852. However, long before Mr. Haley's arrival, scores of immigrants from Kentucky and Virginia ventured into the region as early as 1829. In 1872, John Beaumont donated 10,000 young maple trees Because of these 10,000 trees, Macon has been named "The City of Maples"&lt;/p&gt;
series 2 of 10 caches. will be in the city parks or around the lakes., around long branch lakes. and some somewhere in the city.</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;In 1863 the county seat removed from Bloomington to Macon. It took the bill only 48 hours to become law. For their first courthouse in City of Macon , the court appointed Fred Rowland superintendent, who was to present a plan to the court for consideration. They approved the plan March 9, 1864. Levi Aldrich was architect and contractor. In February 1864 the court had appropriated $10,000 from the general fund and ordered that the money be raised by a special tax. After seeing the plan, they appropriated an additional $15,000. Costs ran to approximately $30,000. The county offices moved into the building in September 1865. An annex was added in 1895, costing about $8,500. Today, the 1865 courthouse is a rare example of architecture, representing this turbulent decade of Missouri's history. It has been placed on the National Register of Historic Places.&lt;/p&gt;

I loaded up the road bike and joined over 400 other crazy cyclists to ride across the beautiful state of Missouri in the Big BAM (Bike Across Missouri). We picked the hottest time of the year because we rode in over 100 degrees heat index. But that did not stop me from finding several great caches! I had the GPSr loaded up for each overnight town and for the route I would be riding. 

Thanx to the logs for letting me find this one away from GZ. Lots of construction going on but that did not prevent me from finding this one.

I have family ties to Ottumwa so we concentrated our caches in the area for the most part. After having lunch, caching, visiting grandparents and all around enjoying ourselves, it was time to head back ... in a snow storm ... in the dark ... going 30 MPH on the highway. Needless to say we stopped for the night in Kirksville, MO and decided to local cache in the snow and it turned out to be very fun!

A very familiar building soon came into view as Atomic Goat's Breath and I drove up.  We parked off a side street and began our search for the cache.  New arrivals for the nearby church ignored our activities as we were coming up empty.  Where was this one hiding?  As a chilling numbness began to overtake my fingers, Goat found the cache in a place I had presumably investigated.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">(#2,641) Caching my up Highway 36 and west across Highway 61 from St. Louis to St. Joseph with Pastor G... trying to grab caches in as many counties as we could. By this time... it was after sundown... and I was specifically looking for caches with the "24/7" attribute enabled. I was glad to see as I looked over the next county line we were driving towards... that this one fit the bill.

We made our way through town to where the GPS coordinates pointed us... and then hopped out of the car. We looked all around the tree at ground zero... but came up with nothing. We did several more circlings of the tree... looking up high and down low... but nothing was found. We started circling neighboring trees in the same manner... looking up and down with our flashlights. But still we found nothing.

Finally... getting frustrated and near ready to give up and move on to another cache... I looked in a new location and just barely spotted the cache. After letting the GPS unit settled down... it indicated that the location of the cache was 36 feet west of ground zero.

I took nothing... but left my signature on the log and one of my signature miniature, marbled dice in the container. Thanks for a nice, little cache with great camo, paperclip-JK!</groundspeak:text>

City of Maple 11 Stephens&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The City of Maples series The town of Macon was first settled by James T. Haley in 1852. However, long before Mr. Haley's arrival, scores of immigrants from Kentucky and Virginia ventured into the region as early as 1829. In 1872, John Beaumont donated 10,000 young maple trees Because of these 10,000 trees, Macon has been named "The City of Maples". The city have seven beautiful and well maintained parks and lakes&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;series 8 of 10 caches. will be in the city parks or around the lakes., around long branch lakes. and some somewhere in the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;STEPHENS PROSPERS IN BUSINESS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephens stayed with the firm five years and decided to try the business on his own. After five years of business he formed a co-partnership with his former employer, E.S. Goldsberry and the firm was called Goldsberry and Stephens. This partnership dissolved after 20 months. Stephens continued in business alone dealing in clothing, hats, caps and gentlemen's furnishings. For a 10 month period Mr. Hail ran the dry goods store. The business was sold to Mr. Hail and Mr. Baker in 1883.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephens had married Anna Cravens of Randolph County. They had 11 children and five lived past birth and childhood: Owen Gordon, Mollie Kiett, Lulie Pearl, Leima and Howard Wendall. His clothing business was the leading house in its line in Macon according to The 1884 History of Macon County. Stephens died December 30, 1892 The park was given to the city on September 6, 1886.:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank to the City of Macon mo for your approval placing this cache&lt;/p&gt;

I loaded up the road bike and joined over 400 other crazy cyclists to ride across the beautiful state of Missouri in the Big BAM (Bike Across Missouri). We picked the hottest time of the year because we rode in over 100 degrees heat index. But that did not stop me from finding several great caches! I had the GPSr loaded up for each overnight town and for the route I would be riding. 

Signed the replacement log.

Greetings,

I hate to pop in here like this but from reading the last note or two I see this cache could use a little attention. It is worrisome when a cache with a successful find history has a string of DNF's. The geocaching community would like to know how it's going here. Is your cache still here, its being worked on, that sort of thing. When you get a chance, please log onto your page and give everyone an update by posting a note to your cache page.

I'm temporarily disabling it, to give you an opportunity to stop by and check on the cache.

If you decide that this project has reached it's end you can archive it to remove it from the active cache database.

When everything is OK again, please remember to enable your cache and post an "Owner Maintenance" log on your cache page. This log removes the "needs maintenance" and allows your cache to be shown in the search results of Pocket Queries. Don't let your cache be filtered out unnecessarily in Pocket Queries by forgetting to re-set the attribute!

I want to thank you for the time that you have taken to contribute to Geocaching in the past and I am looking forward to hopefully seeing your cache up and running in the near future.

HOW TO RESPOND IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS

Respond by posting a new Note. Go to the cache page in question, and click on Log Your Visit. Select "Post Note" as the log type, and enter your message. Doing that, I'll know exactly what cache your message pertains to, which will speed the communication process.
If you're reading this as an email, don't reply to the sending address. It won't reach me. Follow the contact instructions above.

Having started from the south, Atomic Goat's Breath and I reasoned that the best approach for the rest of the series would be to grab what was closest.  This cache was next!  The park's drive was soon zooming by the windows, and, after we turned the car around, entered.  Locating the container took but a moment as we realized that a pattern was forming.  Our names were added to the log (AGB &amp; U!), and the container was returned as found.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Got an invite from Arthur of Arthur and Trillian to do a geocache run up 63 and around the northern part of Missouri the other day.   Weather prediction was sunny and 50's for the day after Christmas.  I had not been out for a major cache run since July so I got permission from the muggle wife and our adventure was set.  We left before dawn and the plan was to return after sunset.  This was cache 12 for the day.
  We searched GZ high and low and as we did so two city park pickup trucks drove into the park, one empty trash cans as the other drove slowly around with the driver staring at us like we were criminals up to no good.   That didn't phase us, we non-chalantly determined the cache was not there and then debated on whether to perform a maintainance by putting out a new container.  All three of us are not fond of doing throw downs but A&amp;T were pretty sure we knew the spot and were doubly sure the container was missing.   I had an extra matchstick container in my kit that I have had for several years so I added a pill bag and a log sheet and A&amp;T placed it in a good spot at GZ.  CO can check on this and confirm his container is missing.   Signed log team TAD. TFTC.</groundspeak:text>

The City of Maples series The town of Macon was first settled by James T. Haley in 1852. However, long before Mr. Haley's arrival, scores of immigrants from Kentucky and Virginia ventured into the region as early as 1829. In 1872, John Beaumont donated 10,000 young maple trees Because of these 10,000 trees, Macon has been named "The City of Maples". The city have seven beautiful and well maintained parks and lakes&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Best bets for this lake are Largemouth Bass and Channel Catfish, both species good in size and numbers&lt;/p&gt;

Bringing the vehicle to a stop, Atomic Goat's Breath and I had a decent hunch on where this cache may be hiding.  A short walk confirmed our suspicions and resulted in one more find for the day.  Sadly, this location was not as entertaining as the one previously encountered.  Where were all the water fowl?

Dphickey is replacing baggie, still no cap on the container. I can't say much more without giving away the location, but it was a pleasant area, and overall a fun little series.

P&amp;amp;G&lt;br /&gt;
The City of Maples series The town of Macon was first settled by James T. Haley in 1852. However, long before Mr. Haley's arrival, scores of immigrants from Kentucky and Virginia ventured into the region as early as 1829. In 1872, John Beaumont donated 10,000 young maple trees Because of these 10,000 trees, Macon has been named "The City of Maples". The city have seven beautiful and well maintained parks and lakes 5 of 10&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;For bass, I always start with spinnerbaits. Size, color, and blade design are important factors. When the water is cold, I like to use smaller lures. I’ll keep the spinnerbaits under ¼ oz. Color depends on water clarity. For muddy water, which is often the case after a spring rain, I’ll choose bright colors like chartreuse or orange. If the water is stained, white is by far your most consistent color. For clear water, go with a clear skirt that has silver glitter, or choose a natural color like watermelon (dark green) or pumpkinseed (brown). You can add trailers to spinnerbaits in order to offer a little variety in color. For the blade design, I prefer a single colorado blade for cold water. It gives you the greatest amount of vibration possible. This is especially important if the water is stained or muddy. If the fish are very active, or if you need more flash, go to a colorado/willow tandem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank to the City of Macon mo for your approval placing this cache&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Decided to pick up a few caches today while it is not raining, though pretty cool for July 3rd. Cache is in good shape. TN LN SL Thanks for having this available.

This was the rallying cry when I heard that there was going to be an AWESOME Mega Event in the Omaha, Nebraska, area! Now, I don't know about you, but to be able to head to a really great caching area to attend a Mega is a pretty awesome situation!

So, I made my plans. I knew I was going to drive across Missouri, up to Iowa and over to Nebraska, of course! So I planned...and planned...and planned. I plotted routes, I took caches into consideration. I decided to mainly focus on Earthcaches and Virtuals, but I certainly added others to the mix. If I was going to go on a road trip, I was going to make it fun!

This was day one of the adventure. It found me beginning at home in Fulton, caching my way along US 36 to St. Joseph and on up to Council Bluffs and finally the Omaha area. I had a lot of fun, that's for sure! My sights were originally set on stopping in St. Jo, but I got done with my route so quickly that I said to heck with it...I'd push on to Omaha!

Naturally, along the way I did some caching, and boy was it fun!

If there were answers to be sent, they have been sent. Pics will be uploaded where necessary. [;)]

This cache was the 2nd cache of 69 caches on the day. Thanks for placing this cache for myself and others to enjoy! TNLN/SL TFTC!

Yes, we know where our towels are...

Spotting a bald eagle, Atomic Goat's Breath and I admired the flight while we drove around Macon Lake.  Another sort of winged creature awaited us at the coordinates; in fact, there was an entire flock!  The geese were content to sit on the bank as we drove up.  Having had bad experiences with such creatures in the past, Goat knew what to do to alleviate my concerns.  He drove just close enough to spook them and cause them to take to the air!  We sought the cache amongst loud honking above and had it in hand quickly.  With a few strokes of a pen, our visit was recorded.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Got an invite from Arthur of Arthur and Trillian to do a geocache run up 63 and around the northern part of Missouri the other day.   Weather prediction was sunny and 50's for the day after Christmas.  I had not been out for a major cache run since July so I got permission from the muggle wife and our adventure was set.  We left before dawn and the plan was to return after sunset.  
  This was are first DNF for the day.  There was a fishing muggle at GZ but we did a search and came up with nothing.  Previous logs indicated it may be missing so we walked away....</groundspeak:text>

I originally counted this as a find with the log as "Nope." Now I remember this cache or rather the lack of it. It was a nice area, but it would be very tough to place a cache here, and expect it not to float away or get muggled. Thanks for the effort.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Driving across Missouri on our way home to Lincoln, NE after Family Reunion in Terre Haute. It's a long way. We needed to take a break and stretch a bit so we headed for a cache that was not a micro and looked like it was in a nice location. Yes, it is a lovely spot. Very pretty lake. But the man getting in his truck to leave as we pulled up near GZ said the fishing wasn't very good (that day at least)

Found cache, signed log, walked around a bit, got in car and headed west. TFTC.</groundspeak:text>

The City of Maples series The town of Macon was first settled by James T. Haley in 1852. However, long before Mr. Haley's arrival, scores of immigrants from Kentucky and Virginia ventured into the region as early as 1829. In 1872, John Beaumont donated 10,000 young maple trees Because of these 10,000 trees, Macon has been named "The City of Maples". The city have seven beautiful and well maintained parks and lakes.&lt;/p&gt;

I loaded up the road bike and joined over 400 other crazy cyclists to ride across the beautiful state of Missouri in the Big BAM (Bike Across Missouri). We picked the hottest time of the year because we rode in over 100 degrees heat index. But that did not stop me from finding several great caches! I had the GPSr loaded up for each overnight town and for the route I would be riding. 

I don't understand the poem someone left but everyone has a calling card.

So, we left them behind to find some other caches. Got back a half hour later and replaced with no trouble

Leaving the car, a very chilling wind seemed to pass through me.  An expected location was searched; alas, a cache was not found.  Atomic Goat's Breath suggested a different spot which did indeed contain the geocache after feeling around for a few moments.  How does he do that?

   <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;The City of Maples series The town of Macon was first settled by James T. Haley in 1852. However, long before Mr. Haley's arrival, scores of immigrants from Kentucky and Virginia ventured into the region as early as 1829. In 1872, John Beaumont donated 10,000 young maple trees Because of these 10,000 trees, Macon has been named "The City of Maples". This one in long branch state park.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;series 4 of 10 caches. will be in the city parks or around the lakes., around long branch lakes. and some somewhere in the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citizen involvement in hospital health care needs is a tradition that began with Mr. and Mrs. Gary in the late 1920s. The lack of modern hospital facilities in Macon County prompted the Garys to envision, build, and equip a hospital in Macon. In early 1943, the judges of Macon County Court signed an agreement to take over the management of the hospital, and the hospital was officially named Macon County Samaritan Memorial Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;

I loaded up the road bike and joined over 400 other crazy cyclists to ride across the beautiful state of Missouri in the Big BAM (Bike Across Missouri).

ScrapLadyS needed a ride-along buddy to go see her son pitch some college baseball, so what better than to make it a georoad trip?  We planned a few dozen caches, but time and distance prevented us from doing all of them.  No worries.  Better to have too many than too few.  This cache was one that we picked up during the weekend.  Thank you for placing it!

Some of these may be logged out of order due to some weird happening with the app.  They aren't in order there.  O.o</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I have absolutely no cell service here for some reason--like this whole county seems to be a black out region. Glad I had saved this one to an offline list. Stopped in McDonalds nearby to upload more caches just in case my phone was a lost cause the rest of this county cache run, but after leaving this county I only had problems in the county directly to the west--weird deal. Anyway thanks so much for sharing the cache--helped me claim the county. Thanks again!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">wrenberlin and I made the trek to Iowa for another state badge as neither of us had that state. Rainy drive there, snowy drive back. I have family ties to Ottumwa so we concentrated our caches in the area for the most part. After having lunch, caching, visiting grandparents and all around enjoying ourselves, it was time to head back ... in a snow storm ... in the dark ... going 30 MPH on the highway. Needless to say we stopped for the night in Kirksville, MO and decided to local cache in the snow and it turned out to be very fun!

nice spot in town under a tree ... while signing the log snow kept falling off the branches onto my head! TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">November Ghost and myself + the geo-pibble decided this Saturday was a good day to find a cache in the great state of Iowa. Yes, that would be the same day a snowstorm was predicted to blow through. Despite logic, our adventurous streak prevailed, and we left from Columbia, MO, early in the day to visit Ottumwa, IA, where November Ghost has family roots. Ottumwa is quite charming! I learned how delicious a canteen lunch is while overhearing the locals discussing the brewing snow. Still un-phased by the talk of ferocious flurries, we spent the afternoon finding many fine caches. Our trip included a visit to Ghost’s past and a test of courage involving climbing up the slippery branches of a tree in the rain. You bet we exchanged some high fives after tackling that one. Around 5 or 6, it finally dawned on us that there was supposed to be some inclement weather on the way. Still, we dilly-dallied at a diner before finally getting out on the road as the sun was setting. Did I mention that I’m from the south, and that I’d never driven through snow before? November Ghost was behind the wheel… but that doesn’t mean he could actually see the road. And neither could I. I don’t think I’ve ever been that terrified due to weather. Now I know what those bumps on the sides of the lane are for! Driving blind proved to be much too stressful, so we stopped in Kirksville, MO for the night (and I found my first cache in the snow!) We made it home safe and sound on Sunday morning, and with a hearty respect for Mother Nature. Many thanks to all of the cachers who placed the hides we found on our trip!

Sunday morning, I woke up to a lovely blanket of snow and took the geo-pibble for a walk in it. Turns out, she loves snow! After a morning meetup at the golden arches for coffee, November Ghost and I took the jeep out to make some fresh tracks through the field of white. There was a lot of yellow snow around the tree. It looked as if a horde of dogs with full bladders had gathered there. Turns out it was stained water from the leaves. The geo-pibble romped in the snow some more while Ghost signed the log. Thanks for all the hides!</groundspeak:text>

Turning our sights east, Atomic Goat's Breath and I were quick to arrive at the location for this geocache.  We parked very close by what we presumed was the hiding place for the cache.  Feeling around brought forth a container with a log to sign.  Once replaced, we continued on to what promised to be a "green" cache.  With the nature of our sport, how could it be more green?</groundspeak:text>

City of Maple 9  swimming&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The City of Maples series The town of Macon was first settled by James T. Haley in 1852. However, long before Mr. Haley's arrival, scores of immigrants from Kentucky and Virginia ventured into the region as early as 1829. In 1872, John Beaumont donated 10,000 young maple trees Because of these 10,000 trees, Macon has been named "The City of Maples". The city have seven beautiful and well maintained parks and lakes&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;series 9 of 10 caches. will be in the city parks or around the lakes., around long branch lakes. and some somewhere in the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The St. James Academy opened in 1875 jest south of the lake; Blees became its headmaster in 1892. Upon the death of his parents, Blees came into a substantial inheritance, which he invested in the construction of Blees Military Academy. The school survived only until 1912. In 1914, it became the Still-Hildreth Sanatorium, which closed in the 1960s. The building was fully renovated in the 1980s, and it is now known as Lakeview Towers, a senior residential facility. The lake was part of the St. James Academy. The lake was a favorite place for many years for the people in Macon for swimming and fishing. now their no swimming in the lake. Thanks to the City of Macon mo for your approval placing this cache&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

### **STATUS UPDATE NEEDED** ###

-------------

Greetings, 

I hate to pop in here like this but from reading the last note or two, I see this cache might need a little attention. It is worrisome when a cache with a successful find history has a string of DNF's. The geocaching community would like to know how it's going here. Is your cache still here, is it being worked on, that sort of thing. When you get a chance, please log onto your page and give everyone an update by posting a note to your cache page.

If it is not disabled already, I will temporarily disable your cache   to give you an opportunity to stop by and check on your cache.

If you haven't had time to check on it by my next check I'll go ahead and archive it then.
If you decide that this project has reached its end you can archive it now to remove it from the active cache database.

When everything is OK again, please remember to enable your cache and post an "Owner Maintenance" log on your cache page. This log removes the "needs maintenance" and allows your cache to be shown in the search results of Pocket Queries. Don't let your cache be filtered out unnecessarily in Pocket Queries by forgetting to reset the attribute!
I want to thank you for the time that you have taken to contribute to Geocaching in the past and I am looking forward to hopefully seeing your cache up and running in the near future.

HOW TO RESPOND IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS
Respond by posting a new Note. Go to the cache page in question, and click on Log Your Visit. Select "Post Note" as the log type, and enter your message. Doing that, I'll know exactly what cache your message pertains to, which will speed the communication process.
If you're reading this as an email, don't reply to the sending address. It won't reach me. Follow the contact instructions above.

Macon!  It had been too long since my last visit, and, with Atomic Goat's Breath accompanying me, the visit would certainly be memorable.  We discussed the proper way to approach this cache as we came into proximity and eventually settled on a gravel drive.

Previous finders are correct the Camo needs to be redone on this one - looks like weather has taken its toll - but cache is in good condition.

Was in the area with Cribbage Witch - On our frequent route from St. Louis to St Joseph Area and back through KC to visit with the Folks in Maysville and the kids in KC.  We decided to pick up a few caches to give ourselves time to stretch.    Even though the trip was about double the length, Geocaching seemed to make it feel it went twice as fast.    Thanks for putting these out to make our trip more enjoyable today.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I was on a trip to look at a corn plot East of St. Louis today,with a little time to cache along the way. I usually go through Hannibal but decided to go a different route to add some counties in Missouri. 


This was the highlight of the day - a few miles out of the way but I am certainly glad I made the trip. I love places like this that I would have never seen without geocaching.  It deserves and I'll give a favorite, though I still don't get the cache name.  I'll post some pics when I get home.  

Clever hide, one at a similar beacon but hidden differently in Madrid Iowa, if you ever get there stop by.  I prefer the hiding spot here.  

Grabbed a TB, SL TFTC !</groundspeak:text>

It was dark, and I was drained after a somewhat disappointing day of geocaching.  Should I go after another en route?  The idea wasn't horrible, and it might end the trip on a good note.  Arriving, I was pleasantly surprised that this wouldn't be a standard park-and-grab.  The memorial was indeed cool, and the site interesting to visit!  Locating the geocache at night was a tad difficult but not impossible.  With everything replaced as discovered, I lingered a bit and reflected on life while gazing up at the stars and Milky Way.  The night sky was amazingly clear and detailed this far from any metropolitan areas.  Simply incredible.

Thank you for a great end to an otherwise hum-drum day of geocaching!

Took nothing, left nothing.</groundspeak:text>

Was in the area with Cribbage Witch - On our frequent route from St. Louis to St Joseph Area and back through KC to visit with the Folks in Maysville and the kids in KC.  We decided to pick up a few caches to give ourselves time to stretch.    Even though the trip was about double the length, Geocaching seemed to make it feel it went twice as fast.    Thanks for putting these out to make our trip more enjoyable today.</groundspeak:text>

Weather prediction was sunny and 50's for the day after Christmas.  I had not been out for a major cache run since July so I got permission from the muggle wife and our adventure was set.  We left before dawn and the plan was to return after sunset.  This was cache 8 for the day.  Signed log team TAD.</groundspeak:text>

I am not gonna lie...we had a lot of fun, toured the northern reaches of our area and found some great caches. This is why I like caching...spending time with people, sharing common interests and a sense of adventure! What an awesome way to spend some time with awesome folks!

We crossed the road, and each chose the path we thought would be the least muddy. It seemed that there ustabe trains through here and I wondered whether the tracks had been built next to the road or if the road had been paved next to the tracks.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I guess I get the FTSTNL (First To Sign The New Log) award.  We were on a run to the Central Christian College of the Bible Book Store today, so that made for a good time to pick up a few caches in the Moberly area.  The wife was finishing up her Christmas list.   Good use of the description and the hints.  We were able to make the grab and get log signed.  TFTC.

Was in the area with Cribbage Witch - On our frequent route from St. Louis to St Joseph Area and back through KC to visit with the Folks in Maysville and the kids in KC.  We decided to pick up a few caches to give ourselves time to stretch.    Even though the trip was about double the length, Geocaching seemed to make it feel it went twice as fast.    Thanks for putting these out to make our trip more enjoyable today.</groundspeak:text>

The wife wanted to make a trip to the Central Christian College of the Bible Book Store today, so that made for a good time to pick up a few caches in the Moberly area.   Good use of the description and the hints.  We were able to make the grab and get log signed.  TFTC.

As I was signing the log the owner of the near-by business came out waving flowers and wanting to talk peacefully.  I decided not to stick around.

The last date that A Charlie brown Christmas aired on CBS was Decembers 25th, 2000. The Next month the rights were sold to ABC and is currently aired in December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is in Rothwell Park and is an easy find. It might just be the easiest cache you ever find. You will understand once you see it. Bring a pen. Could be used for small trade items. Please place back as you found it as you can see this one from the trail if you don't. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Geocaching please respect and follow the rules of the park. The Park is open to the public daily from 5:00 a.m.-11:00 p.m. Do not damage any of the parks property, tress, or other wildlife. Hope you enjoy the park and its amenities.&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Another FTF run.   All week I've been checking the new Peanuts cache in Moberly to see if anyone found it.  All week it sat.  Amazing.   So today, with nothing better to do, I decided to run to Moberly and find all the caches I have not found yet in the series and not in the series.  Then Arthur and Trillian texted me and I filled him in on my plans.   We modified our plans for him to join me and grab the caches he needed.    Finally we arrived at the last cache in the park I had not found.  We made our way down the access road and onto ground zero.  I spotted the telltale tree right off.   Logged the cache and we headed off to another park so A&amp;T could log the last of the Peanuts caches he needed.  TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

I was out and about caching along the I-44 corridor, having just bagged a FTF in St. James, when what do I hear? Dings of emails! New, it's not safe to check them while driving, so at the first convenient spot, I looked to see what was up. Two new caches in Moberly! Well, I figured I was way too far away to even have a possibility to get them, so I reverently passed on them.

Fast forward to today. I was making my rounds on the internet when I checked the geocaching website and lo and behold, the caches were not found yet! What the heck, I figured...let's go for them!

So, I packed up my stuff and took off. In no time, I was there. I got to ground zero just fine and found the container. I had an idea what I was looking for, and my hunch paid off. Nice placement!

Thanks for the fun cache! TNLN/SL TFTC!

   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This cache is part of the Peanuts Gang series in Rothwell Park and Lion's Beuth park. I have chosen the area because there is many areas you can park and still get to more than one cache by walking and then can get back into your vehicle and park again to get the next set of caches. You can also if you want walk or bike the nice trails in the area to get to most of the caches. There are also many things to do in the park, plan to bring the family and stay for more enjoyment after your cache adventure that will take you to many areas of the park including around the lake which will give you good views. If you do bring your kids please watch them when around vehicle used areas and the lake caches are not next to the water and you will have several feet if they get away from you. Most to all the cache should not take long to find depending on your expertise.V1p3rx and I have worked to make the series fun and not finding the same old thing over and over. You will find a couple different styles of hides and also one that is maybe not be the expected way to retrieve the cache from the rest of the series. Stealth may be required due to being close to trails, or areas people may visit. We have attempted to give you geocover in all areas but it is a park. Please make sure the cache is hidden well when you place it back into its hiding spot. There is a archery range in the area so use caution even though caches are not placed in the area of the archery. Hope you enjoy the area and caches available in the park and this series.   &lt;/p&gt;

It was later discovered he had colon cancer that had metastasized. Once Schulz started chemotherapy he was unable to see clearly. Schulz on February 12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 2000 died in his sleep around 9:45 P.M. from colon cancer.

Linus did not have a name until three days after his appearance. Linus was first mention on July 14.  Linus is the middle child and brother to older sister Lucy Van Pelt and younger brother Rerun Van Pelt. He is known to be best friends with Charlie Brown. In 1954 was first year that Linus talked and on June 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;, was shown with his blue blanket and is often sucking on his thumb.

I was sitting at home doing not much of anything, when all of a sudden my email pinged. New cache! I hurriedly looked to see where it was, and wouldn't you know it? It was in the place I was in very recently...Moberly! Well, not long after, my email pinged again. Another in Moberly! It pinged again...and again...and AGAIN! All told, I saw eight caches pop up!

There was no way I was going to let them slide, so I messaged dphickey and asked him if he wanted to go on an epic FTF run with me. At first he said he couldn't go. I knew I was going anyway, so I told him I'd check as I got closer to Columbia. Sure enough, when I got close to town, he said he was able and ready to go! I picked him up and we took off north to Moberly!

This was the fourth cache of the evening. I pulled into the park, only to see the gates closed and locked. Looking at the cache page, it said that the park closed at 11 p.m., so we went for it, leaving the car parked at the gate. We walked to the appointed area and I immediately beaded onto a likely spot. Searching high and low yielded nothing until I glanced at another nearby tree where this was hidden. Bingo.

FTF-3 DNF-1

Thanks for the fun cache! TNLN/SL TFTC!

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">CO-FTF with A&amp;T.   After finding the big sister we made our way to the parking area.   The gates to the park were closed which was perplexing so we did a double check on the hours to make sure we were not going in when we were not supposed to.  Hours on the cache page indicated we were well within the hours of the park so we walked the rest of the way in, and after arriving at what appeared to be GZ we came up blank.   Hmm, maybe look around and the flashlight fell on another spot very close by that was not visible in the dark and trees (couldn't see the tree in the forest so to speak) and another quick search found the subject of the cache and his blanket.  We signed the logs and made our way back to the car.  3 Finds 1 DNF   TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

&lt;p&gt;Franklin Armstrong Was introduced July 31&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;, 1968 as the first black charter in the comic strip. His last appearance was November 5&lt;sup&gt;th,&lt;/sup&gt; 1999 until he appeared in The Peanuts Movie on November 6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 2015. He went to school with Peppermint Patty and Marcie in his first story, Charlie Brown and Franklin meet on the beach. His father was a solder in the Vietnam War.  Franklin was introduced to the peanuts gang when a Los Angeles school teacher named Harriet Glickman wrote Schultz in the spring of 1968 asking him to bring a black character to the comic strip. His last name is consider a apocryphal because the only time his last name is talked about is in the T.V. special you’re in the Super Bowl, Charlie Brown. He is only referred as Franklin in the Comic Strip and other T.V. specials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Geocaching please respect and follow the rules of the park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Park is open to the public daily from 5:00 a.m.-11:00 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not damage any of the parks property, tress, or other wildlife.&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Another FTF run.   All week I've been checking the new Peanuts cache in Moberly to see if anyone found it.  All week it sat.  Amazing.   So today, with nothing better to do, I decided to run to Moberly and find all the caches I have not found yet in the series and not in the series.  Then Arthur and Trillian texted me and I filled him in on my plans.   We modified our plans for him to join me and grab the caches he needed.    We decided to go after the FTF first.  We made our way up 63 then to the park.   We parked in a familiar area only this time in daylight.   We quickly made our way across the railroad and into the woods.   A&amp;T spotted the cache and after a breif wait for the retreival we had a fresh virgin log.   CO-FTF for us.   After signing in we moved on to the next cache to revenge a DNF.

I was sitting at home doing not much of anything, chatting with dphickey about this and that, when he mentioned that he was thinking about a caching run up to Moberly. He wanted to avenge some DNF's, find some new caches and go for a FTF! Well, we teamed up to go accomplish these very goals. I needed a couple he had and he needed a couple I had, so with mutual goals, we set off!

We decided to go for the FTF attempt first, so this is the one we attacked. We parked in a very similar spot where we got another FTF a week or so ago, and took off toward the cache. The walk was nice and easy and in no time we were at ground zero. Cache was in hand very quickly, and we were delighted to find a blank log! We happily scribbled out FTF initials, put everything back as it was, and took off toward the next cache.

Thanks for the fun cache! TNLN/SL TFTC!

   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This cache is part of the Peanuts Gang series in Rothwell Park and Lion's Beuth park. I have chosen the area because there is many areas you can park and still get to more than one cache by walking and then can get back into your vehicle and park again to get the next set of caches. You can also if you want walk or bike the nice trails in the area to get to most of the caches. There are also many things to do in the park, plan to bring the family and stay for more enjoyment after your cache adventure that will take you to many areas of the park including around the lake which will give you good views. If you do bring your kids please watch them when around vehicle used areas and the lake caches are not next to the water and you will have several feet if they get away from you. Most to all the cache should not take long to find depending on your expertise.V1p3rx and I have worked to make the series fun and not finding the same old thing over and over. You will find a couple different styles of hides and also one that is maybe not be the expected way to retrieve the cache from the rest of the series. Stealth may be required due to being close to trails, or areas people may visit. We have attempted to give you geocover in all areas but it is a park. Please make sure the cache is hidden well when you place it back into its hiding spot. There is a archery range in the area so use caution even though caches are not placed in the area of the archery. Hope you enjoy the area and caches available in the park and this series.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charles (Sparky) Monroe Schulz was born on November 22nd, 1922 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, but grow up in St. Paul Minnesota at the age of 77 he passed away on February 12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 2000 in Santa Rosa, California. Schulz first comic strip was called &lt;em&gt;Li’l Folks and ran from June 1947-January 1950 in the&lt;/em&gt; St. Paul Pioneer Press. In Li’l Folks was the first time Schulz used the name Charlie Brown and he created a dog that also looked much like Snoopy. In May of 1948 Schulz sold the first of his one panel drawing to The Saturday Evening Post. After his Li’l Folks comic strip was dropped in the 1950’s, Schulz went to United Feature Syndicated with the one panel Li’I Folks. Interested in his one panel comic, However Schulz had developed a normal four panel strip and at that time and United Feature Syndicated became interested and decided to publish a four panel comic. Peanuts made its debut on October 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt;, 1950, in seven different newspapers. The popular weekly Sunday page made its first appearance on January 6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 1952. When the Peanuts comic strip was on top, it was published every day in 2,600 papers in 75 countries, 21 languages. In almost 50 years the Peanuts comic strip was produced Schulz drew nearly 18,000 strips. Between the comic strips, merchandise, product endorsement produced revenues of more than 1 billion per year. Schulz’s estimated earrings was 30-40 million annually. The Peanuts comic strip only once why Schulz was alive have reshowings when Schulz went on vacation for five-weeks to celebrate his 75&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; birthday. Schulz never had assistants creating the strip and refused to hire an inker or letterer. On December 14&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; 1999 Schulz announced his retirement due to having several small strokes and a blocked aorta. It was later discovered he had colon cancer that had metastasized. Once Schulz started chemotherapy he was unable to see clearly. Schulz on February 12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 2000 died in his sleep around 9:45 P.M. from colon cancer. The last original Peanuts comic strip was produced the next day on Sunday, February 13&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;. Charles Monroe Schulz is buried in Pleasant Hill Cemetery in Sebastopol, California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patricia “Peppermint Patty” Reichardt first appearance was made on August 22&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt;, 1966. The last appearance was made in January 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt;, 2000. She then made a appearance on November 6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; , 2015 in The Peanuts Movie. In 1967 she made her debut in the TV special You’re in Love, Charlie Brown. Peppermint Patty was first introduced in the comic strip as a baseball coach against Charlie Brown. In 1967 TV specials, she refers to Charlie Brown as “Chuck” and Lucy as “Lucille”. Peppermint Patty’s birthday is on October 4&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 1970 in the comic strip Patty’s father gave her roses on her birthday. Peppermint Patty’s father calls her his “rare gem”.&lt;/p&gt;

A dedication was passed as I walked to the coordinates for this cache.  It's amazing how much changes in just a few years; I remember this area simply being a field with some sparse trees!  Soon, leaving the path was necessary for finding the cache.  The hide was discovered with little difficulty but required a bit of a stretch to reach.  With the log signed, I returned to the car.

There were three other hides just on the other side of the Christmas light display.  Hmmm . . . how would I get over there?  Soon, I was in line for the light show to scope out potential approaches (and to enjoy the drive).  Who knew that Moberly had a moose crossing or that Santa drove a tractor?  [:P]  It was a nicely put together and enjoyable event.

Coming to the end, I parked and decided to dare walking across the show to the caches.  I darted into the shadows whenever a car approached and soon entered the woods.  A disc golf course pathway was followed but only to a point.  The telltale yips and barks of several coyote caught my attention.  Nope!  There was no way I would risk running into a pack of coyote for a cache.  Those on the other side of the light show would have to wait until another day.</groundspeak:text>

I was sitting at home doing not much of anything, when all of a sudden my email pinged. New cache! I hurriedly looked to see where it was, and wouldn't you know it? It was in the place I was in very recently...Moberly! Well, not long after, my email pinged again. Another in Moberly! It pinged again...and again...and AGAIN! All told, I saw eight caches pop up!

There was no way I was going to let them slide, so I messaged dphickey and asked him if he wanted to go on an epic FTF run with me. At first he said he couldn't go. I knew I was going anyway, so I told him I'd check as I got closer to Columbia. Sure enough, when I got close to town, he said he was able and ready to go! I picked him up and we took off north to Moberly!

This was the sixth cache of the evening. We arrived at the location for this cache and walked cheerily to ground zero. Only a wee bit of looking is what it took to nail this one.

   <groundspeak:short_description html="True">When going for this cache depending if we have had precipitation it could be very muddy. Should be able to stay to the edge without getting in the mud. It also in the summer could be some bush wacking to get to the cache. This is a neat area and saw several animals and signs of them when hiding it. Please respect the campers areas when you start your search for this cache</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This cache is part of the Peanuts Gang series in Rothwell Park and Lion's Beuth park. I have chosen the area because there is many areas you can park and still get to more than one cache by walking and then can get back into your vehicle and park again to get the next set of caches. You can also if you want walk or bike the nice trails in the area to get to most of the caches. There are also many things to do in the park, plan to bring the family and stay for more enjoyment after your cache adventure that will take you to many areas of the park including around the lake which will give you good views. If you do bring your kids please watch them when around vehicle used areas and the lake caches are not next to the water and you will have several feet if they get away from you. Most to all the cache should not take long to find depending on your expertise.V1p3rx and I have worked to make the series fun and not finding the same old thing over and over. You will find a couple different styles of hides and also one that is maybe not be the expected way to retrieve the cache from the rest of the series. Stealth may be required due to being close to trails, or areas people may visit. We have attempted to give you geocover in all areas but it is a park. Please make sure the cache is hidden well when you place it back into its hiding spot. There is a archery range in the area so use caution even though caches are not placed in the area of the archery. Hope you enjoy the area and caches available in the park and this series.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charles (Sparky) Monroe Schulz was born on November 22nd, 1922 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, but grow up in St. Paul Minnesota at the age of 77 he passed away on February 12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 2000 in Santa Rosa, California. Schulz first comic strip was called &lt;em&gt;Li’l Folks and ran from June 1947-January 1950 in the&lt;/em&gt; St. Paul Pioneer Press. In Li’l Folks was the first time Schulz used the name Charlie Brown and he created a dog that also looked much like Snoopy. In May of 1948 Schulz sold the first of his one panel drawing to The Saturday Evening Post. After his Li’l Folks comic strip was dropped in the 1950’s, Schulz went to United Feature Syndicated with the one panel Li’I Folks. Interested in his one panel comic, However Schulz had developed a normal four panel strip and at that time and United Feature Syndicated became interested and decided to publish a four panel comic. Peanuts made its debut on October 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt;, 1950, in seven different newspapers. The popular weekly Sunday page made its first appearance on January 6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 1952. When the Peanuts comic strip was on top, it was published every day in 2,600 papers in 75 countries, 21 languages. In almost 50 years the Peanuts comic strip was produced Schulz drew nearly 18,000 strips. Between the comic strips, merchandise, product endorsement produced revenues of more than 1 billion per year. Schulz’s estimated earrings was 30-40 million annually. The Peanuts comic strip only once why Schulz was alive have reshowings when Schulz went on vacation for five-weeks to celebrate his 75&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; birthday. Schulz never had assistants creating the strip and refused to hire an inker or letterer. On December 14&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; 1999 Schulz announced his retirement due to having several small strokes and a blocked aorta. It was later discovered he had colon cancer that had metastasized. Once Schulz started chemotherapy he was unable to see clearly. Schulz on February 12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 2000 died in his sleep around 9:45 P.M. from colon cancer. The last original Peanuts comic strip was produced the next day on Sunday, February 13&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;. Charles Monroe Schulz is buried in Pleasant Hill Cemetery in Sebastopol, California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schroeder-Made his first appearance in comic strips in May 30&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 1951. On that date he was introduced as a baby. The last appearance was made September 12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 1999 in comic stipes. In 1954 Schroeder birthday was revealed as January 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;. Schroeder is known for being one of Charlie Browns best finds and having Lucy Van Pelt leaning on his Piano as he plays. The Piano idea came from Schulz daughter Meredith's toy Piano and that is when Schroeder was born. The first appearance for the piano was on September 24, 1951.Schroeder’s home address was 1770 James Street because 1770 was the year Beethoven was born. The origin of Schroeder’s name came from Schulz's 1975 book called &lt;em&gt;Peanuts Jubilee&lt;/em&gt;: "Schroeder was named after a young boy Charles Schulz used to caddy for at Highland Park golf course in St. Paul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

I picked him up and we took off north to Moberly!

This was the eighth and final cache of the evening. We arrived at the best location I could find to park and set off into the woods. We walked to and fro and about halfway into the trip, the batteries on my GPSr died! Oh well...here comes the phone! Not my favorite way, but you gotta do what you gotta do. Anyway, we made the journey just fine and found the final pristine log.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">This was the final of the Peanuts caches that we found tonight.  We parked .21 miles from the cache and made our way to GZ via an access road new the children's train tracks. Then things got tougher as the road veered off and we bushwhacked into the woods at around  .1 mile from the cache.   The closer we got the more I ran into sticker bushes and low hanging branches....   I don't recommend being crazy like some certain cachers who did this at night.   But it's December and I didn't run into any spider webs or pick up any ticks and we were geocaching... so all was good.   Once we got withing 20 feet we saw what we thought would be the spot and sure enough there was stoic piano player with the clean log that we got to put the first signatures on.   All in all a great series and I will definitely return for the 2 DNFS and the 2 or 3 of the other caches in the series that were published earlier.  TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

   <groundspeak:short_description html="True">Cache should be easy to find. There is a small hill. you will have to get low to find this cache, may even have to get a knee on the ground.</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This cache is part of the Peanuts Gang series in Rothwell Park and Lion's Beuth park. I have chosen the area because there is many areas you can park and still get to more than one cache by walking and then can get back into your vehicle and park again to get the next set of caches. You can also if you want walk or bike the nice trails in the area to get to most of the caches. There are also many things to do in the park, plan to bring the family and stay for more enjoyment after your cache adventure that will take you to many areas of the park including around the lake which will give you good views. If you do bring your kids please watch them when around vehicle used areas and the lake caches are not next to the water and you will have several feet if they get away from you. Most to all the cache should not take long to find depending on your expertise.V1p3rx and I have worked to make the series fun and not finding the same old thing over and over. You will find a couple different styles of hides and also one that is maybe not be the expected way to retrieve the cache from the rest of the series. Stealth may be required due to being close to trails, or areas people may visit. We have attempted to give you geocover in all areas but it is a park. Please make sure the cache is hidden well when you place it back into its hiding spot. There is a archery range in the area so use caution even though caches are not placed in the area of the archery. Hope you enjoy the area and caches available in the park and this series.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charles (Sparky) Monroe Schulz was born on November 22nd, 1922 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, but grow up in St. Paul Minnesota at the age of 77 he passed away on February 12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 2000 in Santa Rosa, California. Schulz first comic strip was called &lt;em&gt;Li’l Folks and ran from June 1947-January 1950 in the&lt;/em&gt; St. Paul Pioneer Press. In Li’l Folks was the first time Schulz used the name Charlie Brown and he created a dog that also looked much like Snoopy. In May of 1948 Schulz sold the first of his one panel drawing to The Saturday Evening Post. After his Li’l Folks comic strip was dropped in the 1950’s, Schulz went to United Feature Syndicated with the one panel Li’I Folks. Interested in his one panel comic, However Schulz had developed a normal four panel strip and at that time and United Feature Syndicated became interested and decided to publish a four panel comic. Peanuts made its debut on October 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt;, 1950, in seven different newspapers. The popular weekly Sunday page made its first appearance on January 6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 1952. When the Peanuts comic strip was on top, it was published every day in 2,600 papers in 75 countries, 21 languages. In almost 50 years the Peanuts comic strip was produced Schulz drew nearly 18,000 strips. Between the comic strips, merchandise, product endorsement produced revenues of more than 1 billion per year. Schulz’s estimated earrings was 30-40 million annually. The Peanuts comic strip only once why Schulz was alive have reshowings when Schulz went on vacation for five-weeks to celebrate his 75&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; birthday. Schulz never had assistants creating the strip and refused to hire an inker or letterer. On December 14&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; 1999 Schulz announced his retirement due to having several small strokes and a blocked aorta. It was later discovered he had colon cancer that had metastasized. Once Schulz started chemotherapy he was unable to see clearly. Schulz on February 12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 2000 died in his sleep around 9:45 P.M. from colon cancer. The last original Peanuts comic strip was produced the next day on Sunday, February 13&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;. Charles Monroe Schulz is buried in Pleasant Hill Cemetery in Sebastopol, California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:1.6;"&gt;Pig Pen-Pig Pen made his first appearance on July 13&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:1.6;"&gt;, 1954 in comic strip and His last appearance was September 8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:1.6;"&gt;, 1999 in a comic strip and in this comic strip and  was the only time that Pig Pen showed shame of being dirty instead of pride like in early comic strips. Pig Pen was most often seen in dirty overalls with a cloud of dust and dirt following him everywhere he goes. Pig Pen refers to the dust and dirt as the dust of ancient civilizations. Despite not being able to stay clean Charlie Brown accepts him for who he is and defends his uncleanliness in one comic strip and then again in A Charlie Brown Christmas. Pig Pen began being seen on T.V. Specials in the 1960’s, and in all four movies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:1.6;"&gt;When Geocaching please respect and follow the rules of the park.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Park is open to the public daily from 5:00 a.m.-11:00 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not damage any of the parks property, tress, or other wildlife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope you enjoy the park and its amenities.  &lt;/p&gt;

Parking was easily obtained nearby as a pair of gentleman were working at the youth complex.  A short walk brought me close to the coordinates.  Was it just me, or had Moberly spent some decent coin to shape up their park in recent years?  [:D]  A likely hiding place for the cache was discovered, and the find was had soon thereafter.

I was sitting at home doing not much of anything, when all of a sudden my email pinged. New cache! I hurriedly looked to see where it was, and wouldn't you know it? It was in the place I was in very recently...Moberly! Well, not long after, my email pinged again. Another in Moberly! It pinged again...and again...and AGAIN! All told, I saw eight caches pop up!

There was no way I was going to let them slide, so I messaged dphickey and asked him if he wanted to go on an epic FTF run with me. At first he said he couldn't go. I knew I was going anyway, so I told him I'd check as I got closer to Columbia. Sure enough, when I got close to town, he said he was able and ready to go! I picked him up and we took off north to Moberly!

This was the seventh cache of the evening. We arrived at the location for this cache and walked cheerily to ground zero. Discussion about the namesake character ensued. One of the easiest caches of the day, it's location was obvious and we made quick work of it. 

FTF-5 DNF-2

Thanks for the fun cache! TNLN/SL TFTC!

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Apparently the last two times I have been through Randolph county I have forgotten to get a cache. Now I am trying to finish up my Missouri County map and DeLorme challenge and realized that smack dab in the middle I was missing this one. Goodness! So, I found this cache and the multi nearby in order to remedy the situation. Thanks so very much for the quick find. I enjoyed this area quite a bit. Thanks again!</groundspeak:text>

We're on our way home to see what's happening.. We need to be home, and prepare for the Veteran's 4th Annual, Lighted Christmas Parade, in Vinton, IA., the Thursday evening (6 PM)(it's DARK), before Thanksgiving.. (The VFW and AmVets got this Parade started four years ago).. Our Veterans Foreign Wars (VFW), American Veterans (AmVets), American Legion, and Vinton's Vol. Fire Dept., all get together for this Parade.. LOTS of business owners put in their lighted "floats", etc. Really a VERY Pretty Parade, with all the Christmas lighted entries.. We even have some antique cars and trucks, in the parade.....
BTW, we want to THANK YOU, for your Cache(s) and maybe one day we'll BCNU down the road..

PS The cache was only in a Sandwich bag.. NO TB's... We put all in a cammoed Peanut butter jar, put in a new log, a TB, and hid it back in place.. It is ready to go, for now.. [;)] For NOW, you can get rid of the "Needs Maintenance", red cross...[:D]</groundspeak:text>

   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This cache is part of the Peanuts Gang series in Rothwell Park and Lion's Beuth park. I have chosen the area because there is many areas you can park and still get to more than one cache by walking and then can get back into your vehicle and park again to get the next set of caches. You can also if you want walk or bike the nice trails in the area to get to most of the caches. There are also many things to do in the park, plan to bring the family and stay for more enjoyment after your cache adventure that will take you to many areas of the park including around the lake which will give you good views. If you do bring your kids please watch them when around vehicle used areas and the lake caches are not next to the water and you will have several feet if they get away from you. Most to all the cache should not take long to find depending on your expertise.V1p3rx and I have worked to make the series fun and not finding the same old thing over and over. You will find a couple different styles of hides and also one that is maybe not be the expected way to retrieve the cache from the rest of the series. Stealth may be required due to being close to trails, or areas people may visit. We have attempted to give you geocover in all areas but it is a park. Please make sure the cache is hidden well when you place it back into its hiding spot. There is a archery range in the area so use caution even though caches are not placed in the area of the archery. Hope you enjoy the area and caches available in the park and this series.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charles (Sparky) Monroe Schulz was born on November 22nd, 1922 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, but grow up in St. Paul Minnesota at the age of 77 he passed away on February 12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 2000 in Santa Rosa, California. Schulz first comic strip was called &lt;em&gt;Li’l Folks and ran from June 1947-January 1950 in the&lt;/em&gt; St. Paul Pioneer Press. In Li’l Folks was the first time Schulz used the name Charlie Brown and he created a dog that also looked much like Snoopy. In May of 1948 Schulz sold the first of his one panel drawing to The Saturday Evening Post. After his Li’l Folks comic strip was dropped in the 1950’s, Schulz went to United Feature Syndicated with the one panel Li’I Folks. Interested in his one panel comic, However Schulz had developed a normal four panel strip and at that time and United Feature Syndicated became interested and decided to publish a four panel comic. Peanuts made its debut on October 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt;, 1950, in seven different newspapers. The popular weekly Sunday page made its first appearance on January 6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 1952. When the Peanuts comic strip was on top, it was published every day in 2,600 papers in 75 countries, 21 languages. In almost 50 years the Peanuts comic strip was produced Schulz drew nearly 18,000 strips. Between the comic strips, merchandise, product endorsement produced revenues of more than 1 billion per year. Schulz’s estimated earrings was 30-40 million annually. The Peanuts comic strip only once why Schulz was alive have reshowings when Schulz went on vacation for five-weeks to celebrate his 75&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; birthday. Schulz never had assistants creating the strip and refused to hire an inker or letterer. On December 14&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; 1999 Schulz announced his retirement due to having several small strokes and a blocked aorta. It was later discovered he had colon cancer that had metastasized. Once Schulz started chemotherapy he was unable to see clearly. Schulz on February 12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 2000 died in his sleep around 9:45 P.M. from colon cancer. The last original Peanuts comic strip was produced the next day on Sunday, February 13&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;. Charles Monroe Schulz is buried in Pleasant Hill Cemetery in Sebastopol, California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:1.6;"&gt;Snoopy-Snoopy had his first appearance on October 4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;span style="line-height:1.6;"&gt;1950 in a comic strip two days after the start of the comic strip. Snoopy was named November 10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:1.6;"&gt;, 1950.  His last appearance was February 13, 2000 in comic strip. Snoopy was first owned by Lila in the film Snoopy Come Home before becoming the pet dog of Charlie Brown in comic strips, movies, and T.V. Snoopy was insipid with an original drawing from Charles M Schulz’s dog named Spike. Snoopy is a beagle that is unable to talk so his thoughts show up in speech balloons which appeared starting on March 16&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:1.6;"&gt;, 1952. Snoopy started out on his hind legs on January 6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:1.6;"&gt;, 1956 ice skating. Snoopy has an imaginary life as an author, College Student know as Joe Cool, and a World War one Flying Ace. Snoopy actions with other peanut gang charters is. Snoopy can’t talk so his thought are shown in speech balloons. His moods are shown by growls, sobs, and laughter. The time Snoopy is able to talk is in You’re a Good Man, Charlie Brown and Snoopy The Musical.  He can’t remember Charlie Browns name, only thinks of him as the round headed kid. Snoopy is always trying to Kiss Lucy on the cheek and stealing the blanket of Linus. Snoopy has seven siblings but only five of whom are in the comic stip. They are said to be Andy, Belle, Marbles, Olaf and Spike, with Spike most often seen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Parking at the dog park, I left my vehicle with two flashlights in hand.  Hey, one can't be too prepared especially when caching at night!  A bit of stumbling around ensued followed by one mad dash back to the car to park it properly once common sense kicked in.  My second approach unveiled the cache container quickly.  With my signature added, I returned to the car for further adventures around Rothwell Park.</groundspeak:text>

I was sitting at home doing not much of anything, when all of a sudden my email pinged. New cache! I hurriedly looked to see where it was, and wouldn't you know it? It was in the place I was in very recently...Moberly! Well, not long after, my email pinged again. Another in Moberly! It pinged again...and again...and AGAIN! All told, I saw eight caches pop up! 

There was no way I was going to let them slide, so I messaged dphickey and asked him if he wanted to go on an epic FTF run with me. At first he said he couldn't go. I knew I was going anyway, so I told him I'd check as I got closer to Columbia. Sure enough, when I got close to town, he said he was able and ready to go! I picked him up and we took off north to Moberly!

This was the first cache of the evening. We parked at the dog park lot and walked to the area the cache was in. After a little tree dodging, the cache was found. Opening it up, we were greeted by a pristine log! One problem, though...neither of us brought an implement to sully the log with out initials! Well, dphickey went back and got a pen and all was saved!

FTF - 1

Thanks for the fun cache! TNLN/SL TFTC!

I was sitting at home wondering where my wife was as she was well over due from work when a new cache published.  As I normally do I sent a message to Arthur and Trillian saying 'hey look new cache'.  Then another popped up, and another and another.  8 in all.  A&amp;T said he'd pick me up if I went out for the FTF with him.  Well the wife was still late so I said go without out me and continued making dinner.  When the wife finally got home, dinner was ready and once I completed dinner I got a message saying A&amp;T was in COMO and wanted to know if I still couldn't go.   Well no excuse now, I was rushing around getting ready for caching in the dark.  Once he picked me up I worked quickly to enter the new cache coords into my old trusty 60CSX from my phone as we raced up 63.  This was the first cache we attempted.  We parked near the dog park and made our way to ground zero in the dark, and A&amp;T made the quick find only to be foiled by him leaving his pen in the car and me leaving mine in my GPS case that I left on the picnic table near the car when I tied my shoes.  Easy enough solution, I made my way back to the table and retrieved my case and pen and we sign the log A&amp;T and DPH.   Thanks for the new cache.</groundspeak:text>

   <groundspeak:short_description html="True">Just off the trail. You may need a friend to help reach this one.</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is part of the Peanuts Gang series in Rothwell Park and Lion's Beuth park. I have chosen the area because there is many areas you can park and still get to more than one cache by walking and then can get back into your vehicle and park again to get the next set of caches. You can also if you want walk or bike the nice trails in the area to get to most of the caches. There are also many things to do in the park, plan to bring the family and stay for more enjoyment after your cache adventure that will take you to many areas of the park including around the lake which will give you good views. If you do bring your kids please watch them when around vehicle used areas and the lake caches are not next to the water and you will have several feet if they get away from you. Most to all the cache should not take long to find depending on your expertise.V1p3rx and I have worked to make the series fun and not finding the same old thing over and over. You will find a couple different styles of hides and also one that is maybe not be the expected way to retrieve the cache from the rest of the series. Stealth may be required due to being close to trails, or areas people may visit. We have attempted to give you geocover in all areas but it is a park. Please make sure the cache is hidden well when you place it back into its hiding spot. There is a archery range in the area so use caution even though caches are not placed in the area of the archery. Hope you enjoy the area and caches available in the park and this series.
&lt;p&gt;Charles (Sparky) Monroe Schulz was born on November 22nd, 1922 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, but grow up in St. Paul Minnesota at the age of 77 he passed away on February 12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 2000 in Santa Rosa, California. Schulz first comic strip was called &lt;em&gt;Li’l Folks and ran from June 1947-January 1950 in the&lt;/em&gt; St. Paul Pioneer Press. In Li’l Folks was the first time Schulz used the name Charlie Brown and he created a dog that also looked much like Snoopy. In May of 1948 Schulz sold the first of his one panel drawing to The Saturday Evening Post. After his Li’l Folks comic strip was dropped in the 1950’s, Schulz went to United Feature Syndicated with the one panel Li’I Folks. Interested in his one panel comic, However Schulz had developed a normal four panel strip and at that time and United Feature Syndicated became interested and decided to publish a four panel comic. Peanuts made its debut on October 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt;, 1950, in seven different newspapers. The popular weekly Sunday page made its first appearance on January 6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 1952. When the Peanuts comic strip was on top, it was published every day in 2,600 papers in 75 countries, 21 languages. In almost 50 years the Peanuts comic strip was produced Schulz drew nearly 18,000 strips. Between the comic strips, merchandise, product endorsement produced revenues of more than 1 billion per year. Schulz’s estimated earrings was 30-40 million annually. The Peanuts comic strip only once why Schulz was alive have reshowings when Schulz went on vacation for five-weeks to celebrate his 75&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; birthday. Schulz never had assistants creating the strip and refused to hire an inker or letterer. On December 14&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; 1999 Schulz announced his retirement due to having several small strokes and a blocked aorta. It was later discovered he had colon cancer that had metastasized. Once Schulz started chemotherapy he was unable to see clearly. Schulz on February 12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 2000 died in his sleep around 9:45 P.M. from colon cancer. The last original Peanuts comic strip was produced the next day on Sunday, February 13&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;. Charles Monroe Schulz is buried in Pleasant Hill Cemetery in Sebastopol, California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woodstock-The first appearance for Woodstock was March 4&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 1966, Woodstock did not get a name until June 22&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt;, 1970. The last appearance for Woodstock was January 16&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 2000 in comic strip. Woodstock and Snoopy became friends in the daily strip when on April 4&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 1967 when Snoopy was on top of his dog house and a bird later called Woodstock landed on Snoop’s nose and over the next two days began to talk to Snoopy about not liking having to fly South for the winter and how he was not blessed with good flying skills. When Woodstock talks its in chicken scratch with letters and punctuation to show usually sleep or emotions. Snoopy was the only one to really understand. Woodstock became Snoop’s sidekick. The first Role Woodstock had was a Mechanic for Snoop’s WWI Flying ace. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Geocaching please respect and follow the rules of the park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Park is open to the public daily from 5:00 a.m.-11:00 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not damage any of the parks property, tress, or other wildlife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope you enjoy the park and its amenities.  &lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Rainy Sunday cache run.   Sitting at home with a house full of kids I was beginning to get grumpy.  I logged on to Geocaching.com and browsed around and noticed that there was a cache in Moberly that had not been found yet.   FTF run?   Why not.  Asked the wife if she wanted to go for a drive and after completing a few errands we were off.  After getting FTF on another cache in this series I decided to run over to this park and grab some of the series I didn't get on a previous trip as well as rectify a few DNFs.   I picked this one as it was closest.   The wife again stayed in the car as I made my search.   Cache was spotted quickly and I had to push my way into the spot to reach it.   Signed the log and returned to the car only to have my wife tell me I smelled like cat pee.   One thing about the tree that was at GZ, they tend to smell....  TFTC</groundspeak:text>

Well, now this monument was quite familiar.  Parking there, I grabbed my GPS and the one working flashlight.  Remember kids:  spares are always a good idea!  A nearby trail ended abruptly next to a gate leaving me the only option of traversing grass.  Given the brush encountered earlier in the day, this was most welcome!  The hiding place for the cache was evident but took some time to negotiate for the container.  It was found in good shape, and the log was signed.</groundspeak:text>

I was out and about caching along the I-44 corridor, having just bagged a FTF in St. James, when what do I hear? Dings of emails! New, it's not safe to check them while driving, so at the first convenient spot, I looked to see what was up. Two new caches in Moberly! Well, I figured I was way too far away to even have a possibility to get them, so I reverently passed on them.

Fast forward to today. I was making my rounds on the internet when I checked the geocaching website and lo and behold, the caches were not found yet! What the heck, I figured...let's go for them!

So, I packed up my stuff and took off. In no time, I was there. I got to ground zero just fine and found the container. Finding it was no issue...retrieving it was. I am mildly allergic to the host spot. No matter, though...I got it!

Thanks for the fun cache! TNLN/SL TFTC!

   <groundspeak:short_description html="True">Cache has a small hill around it. There is a gravel loop close for parking just try to stay to the side as others do come down the path, or parking on the blacktop with a short walk can also get you to the cache.</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This cache is part of the Peanuts Gang series in Rothwell Park and Lion's Beuth park. I have chosen the area because there is many areas you can park and still get to more than one cache by walking and then can get back into your vehicle and park again to get the next set of caches. You can also if you want walk or bike the nice trails in the area to get to most of the caches. There are also many things to do in the park, plan to bring the family and stay for more enjoyment after your cache adventure that will take you to many areas of the park including around the lake which will give you good views. If you do bring your kids please watch them when around vehicle used areas and the lake caches are not next to the water and you will have several feet if they get away from you. Most to all the cache should not take long to find depending on your expertise.V1p3rx and I have worked to make the series fun and not finding the same old thing over and over. You will find a couple different styles of hides and also one that is maybe not be the expected way to retrieve the cache from the rest of the series. Stealth may be required due to being close to trails, or areas people may visit. We have attempted to give you geocover in all areas but it is a park. Please make sure the cache is hidden well when you place it back into its hiding spot. There is a archery range in the area so use caution even though caches are not placed in the area of the archery. Hope you enjoy the area and caches available in the park and this series.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charles (Sparky) Monroe Schulz was born on November 22nd, 1922 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, but grow up in St. Paul Minnesota at the age of 77 he passed away on February 12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 2000 in Santa Rosa, California. Schulz first comic strip was called &lt;em&gt;Li’l Folks and ran from June 1947-January 1950 in the&lt;/em&gt; St. Paul Pioneer Press. In Li’l Folks was the first time Schulz used the name Charlie Brown and he created a dog that also looked much like Snoopy. In May of 1948 Schulz sold the first of his one panel drawing to The Saturday Evening Post. After his Li’l Folks comic strip was dropped in the 1950’s, Schulz went to United Feature Syndicated with the one panel Li’I Folks. Interested in his one panel comic, However Schulz had developed a normal four panel strip and at that time and United Feature Syndicated became interested and decided to publish a four panel comic. Peanuts made its debut on October 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt;, 1950, in seven different newspapers. The popular weekly Sunday page made its first appearance on January 6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 1952. When the Peanuts comic strip was on top, it was published every day in 2,600 papers in 75 countries, 21 languages. In almost 50 years the Peanuts comic strip was produced Schulz drew nearly 18,000 strips. Between the comic strips, merchandise, product endorsement produced revenues of more than 1 billion per year. Schulz’s estimated earrings was 30-40 million annually. The Peanuts comic strip only once why Schulz was alive have reshowings when Schulz went on vacation for five-weeks to celebrate his 75&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; birthday. Schulz never had assistants creating the strip and refused to hire an inker or letterer. On December 14&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; 1999 Schulz announced his retirement due to having several small strokes and a blocked aorta. It was later discovered he had colon cancer that had metastasized. Once Schulz started chemotherapy he was unable to see clearly. Schulz on February 12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 2000 died in his sleep around 9:45 P.M. from colon cancer. The last original Peanuts comic strip was produced the next day on Sunday, February 13&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;. Charles Monroe Schulz is buried in Pleasant Hill Cemetery in Sebastopol, California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sally Brown- Sally was talked about in early 1959 before she made her first appearance on August 23&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt;, 1959 and her last appearance was made on February 6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 2000. Sally was born on May 26&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 1959. When Charlie Brown her brother found out from a phone call from the hospital that he was a big brother, he ran out of the house yelling that he had a new baby sister. Sally was not named until June 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt;, 1959. Sally took her first step on August 22&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt;, 1960. After her first steps the next day in the comic strip she fell in love with Linus. She started kindergarten September 5&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; 1962.&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Another FTF run.   All week I've been checking the new Peanuts cache in Moberly to see if anyone found it.  All week it sat.  Amazing.   So today, with nothing better to do, I decided to run to Moberly and find all the caches I have not found yet in the series and not in the series.  Then Arthur and Trillian texted me and I filled him in on my plans.   We modified our plans for him to join me and grab the caches he needed.    After the FTF find, we both wanted to revenge the DNF we had on this on our last FTF trip.   After pulling up and parking A&amp;T started to read Unitzoid's FTF log.  One line in the log made me think that the cache was not in the area we searched before and I immediately started looking for areas that fit the other hides in the series.  Bingo, I spotted it from about 15 feet away.   A quick read of the GPS showed it was about 60 feet off from the posted coords.  I signed the log as A&amp;T took a reading to share for future finders.   TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

I was sitting at home doing not much of anything, chatting with dphickey about this and that, when he mentioned that he was thinking about a caching run up to Moberly. He wanted to avenge some DNF's, find some new caches and go for a FTF! Well, we teamed up to go accomplish these very goals. I needed a couple he had and he needed a couple I had, so with mutual goals, we set off!

This was one of the DNF's that we both needed to avenge. We got to the same parking area we went to last time and prepared to engage in a long hunt. I was barely out of the vehicle, ready to get to business, when all of a sudden dphickey announced he had found it! So quickly? Yes he did! It's like he channeled the cache owner's knowledge. No matter...we signed the log, happy to have avenged the DNF we had earlier.

We noticed the cache was about 60-65 feet away from where ground zero was, so we took a new set of coordinates. They may not be exact, but they will bring you a lot closer to where  the cache will be.

Thanks for the fun cache! TNLN/SL TFTC!

Parking not far from the exit to the Christmas light show, I gathered my gear and began walking to the coordinates for this listing.  The trail kept a steady and straight course; however, my anxiousness won out.  The GPS was followed dutifully across a small hill and back to the aforementioned pathway.  There, I entered the woods and soon arrived at the coordinates.

Brush was pushed aside as an area with several likely spots was partially illuminated by my flashlight.  Considerable time was spent poking, prodding and gently moving around bits of debris.  Finally, a sneaky idea came to mind, and the GPS was ignored entirely.  Almost immediately the cache was discovered some distance away.  Huzzah!  After signing my name to the log, I continued on my trek around the park.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I was sitting at home doing not much of anything, when all of a sudden my email pinged. New cache! I hurriedly looked to see where it was, and wouldn't you know it? It was in the place I was in very recently...Moberly! Well, not long after, my email pinged again. Another in Moberly! It pinged again...and again...and AGAIN! All told, I saw eight caches pop up!

There was no way I was going to let them slide, so I messaged dphickey and asked him if he wanted to go on an epic FTF run with me. At first he said he couldn't go. I knew I was going anyway, so I told him I'd check as I got closer to Columbia. Sure enough, when I got close to town, he said he was able and ready to go! I picked him up and we took off north to Moberly!

This was the fifth cache of the evening. We arrived at the location for this cache and began the search. We searched and we searched. We consulted the hint and that didn't do us much good, since the hint was kind of vague, given the area. After a while, we decided to leave this one to go to the next.

Searched high and low, in nooks and crannies but little sis was not having any of it for us tonight.  Can't find them all they say but I am guessing I will try again when the sun is up.

   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This cache is part of the Peanuts Gang series in Rothwell Park and Lion's Beuth park. I have chosen the area because there is many areas you can park and still get to more than one cache by walking and then can get back into your vehicle and park again to get the next set of caches. You can also if you want walk or bike the nice trails in the area to get to most of the caches. There are also many things to do in the park, plan to bring the family and stay for more enjoyment after your cache adventure that will take you to many areas of the park including around the lake which will give you good views. If you do bring your kids please watch them when around vehicle used areas and the lake caches are not next to the water and you will have several feet if they get away from you. Most to all the cache should not take long to find depending on your expertise.V1p3rx and I have worked to make the series fun and not finding the same old thing over and over. You will find a couple different styles of hides and also one that is maybe not be the expected way to retrieve the cache from the rest of the series. Stealth may be required due to being close to trails, or areas people may visit. We have attempted to give you geocover in all areas but it is a park. Please make sure the cache is hidden well when you place it back into its hiding spot. There is a archery range in the area so use caution even though caches are not placed in the area of the archery. Hope you enjoy the area and caches available in the park and this series.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charles (Sparky) Monroe Schulz was born on November 22nd, 1922 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, but grow up in St. Paul Minnesota at the age of 77 he passed away on February 12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 2000 in Santa Rosa, California. Schulz first comic strip was called &lt;em&gt;Li’l Folks and ran from June 1947-January 1950 in the&lt;/em&gt; St. Paul Pioneer Press. In Li’l Folks was the first time Schulz used the name Charlie Brown and he created a dog that also looked much like Snoopy. In May of 1948 Schulz sold the first of his one panel drawing to The Saturday Evening Post. After his Li’l Folks comic strip was dropped in the 1950’s, Schulz went to United Feature Syndicated with the one panel Li’I Folks. Interested in his one panel comic, However Schulz had developed a normal four panel strip and at that time and United Feature Syndicated became interested and decided to publish a four panel comic. Peanuts made its debut on October 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt;, 1950, in seven different newspapers. The popular weekly Sunday page made its first appearance on January 6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 1952. When the Peanuts comic strip was on top, it was published every day in 2,600 papers in 75 countries, 21 languages. In almost 50 years the Peanuts comic strip was produced Schulz drew nearly 18,000 strips. Between the comic strips, merchandise, product endorsement produced revenues of more than 1 billion per year. Schulz’s estimated earrings was 30-40 million annually. The Peanuts comic strip only once why Schulz was alive have reshowings when Schulz went on vacation for five-weeks to celebrate his 75&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; birthday. Schulz never had assistants creating the strip and refused to hire an inker or letterer. On December 14&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; 1999 Schulz announced his retirement due to having several small strokes and a blocked aorta. It was later discovered he had colon cancer that had metastasized. Once Schulz started chemotherapy he was unable to see clearly. Schulz on February 12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 2000 died in his sleep around 9:45 P.M. from colon cancer. The last original Peanuts comic strip was produced the next day on Sunday, February 13&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;. Charles Monroe Schulz is buried in Pleasant Hill Cemetery in Sebastopol, California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charlie Brown-The first time the name Charlie Brown was used was in 1948 in Li’l Folks a comic strip Schulz got his start with. Charlie Browns first appearance was in The Peanuts comic strips was on October 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt;, 1950.  Charlie Browns last appearance in a comic strip was February 13&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 2000.  In a comic strip published on Nov. 3, 1950 suggest that Charlie Brown was born on October 30&lt;sup&gt;th.&lt;/sup&gt; On December 21&lt;sup&gt;st,&lt;/sup&gt; 1950 fans were introduced to Charlie Brows Zig-Zag pattern shirt. On March 6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 1951 Charlie Brown was seen playing baseball, but started out as a catcher. On February 7&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 1951 Charlie Brown was introduced to Violet Gray whom on August 13&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 1951 called Charlie Brown a block head which was the first time this insult was used. On November 14&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of 1951 was the start of Charlie brown being unable to kick a football. Violet Gray was scared that Charlie brown was going to kick her hand and she let go of the football. On January 6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 1952 was the first time Charlie brown was in a Sunday comic strip. March 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; 1952 Lucy Van Pelt was introduced to Charlie Brown. Lucy in the November 16&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 1952 was the first time she prevented Charlie Brown from kicking the football by pulling it away because she did not want to get the football dirty.  In the April 25&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 1952 was the first time Charlie Brown was seen flying a kite in the strip.&lt;/p&gt;

I was sitting at home doing not much of anything, chatting with dphickey about this and that, when he mentioned that he was thinking about a caching run up to Moberly. He wanted to avenge some DNF's, find some new caches and go for a FTF! Well, we teamed up to go accomplish these very goals. I needed a couple he had and he needed a couple I had, so with mutual goals, we set off!

This was one of the DNF's that I needed to avenge. It seemed that dphickey had already found this one, so it was up to me to complete the avenging process for the group. We got to the same parking area we went to last time and I prepared for a hunt. Armed with a better set of coordinates, I found the cache with no problems! I signed the log, happy to have avenged the DNF!

The cache is a bit distant from the posted numbers, so here are the coordinates I used to find the cache. They may not be exact, but they will bring you a lot closer to where the cache will be.

Thanks for the fun cache! TNLN/SL TFTC!

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Rainy Sunday cache run.   Sitting at home with a house full of kids I was beginning to get grumpy.  I logged on to Geocaching.com and browsed around and noticed that there was a cache in Moberly that had not been found yet.   FTF run?   Why not.  Asked the wife if she wanted to go for a drive and after completing a few errands we were off.  After FTF and a find on two other caches in this series I decided to attempt to revenge the DNF I had on a previous visit.   The rain was steady by light and there was much more light than my previous visit but that didn't help much.   GPS pointed me right back to the spot I was in the previous night.   So I did the search as before, expanded it a bit, checked the hint, started over and searched more, expanded even farther...   Finally I decided it was time for a PAF.   Drat the phone number of my source was deleted when my phone had that hiccup....  Searching previous call logs rectified the situation, and the information that the coords may be a bit off was given.  Given new data I focused my search and sure enough the cache was found.  Retrieving it took a bit of work, and a madeshift TOTT that I fashioned out of some debris nearby and cache was in hand and signed.   Replacing the cache took a bit of work but once done all was good and ready for the finder.   This was the last of the day as once again it was getting dark and the other DNF nearby had a muggle parked right at GZ doing who knows what..   Decided to call it a day.   TFTC</groundspeak:text>

Knowing that this cache might be elusive, I approached with some trepidation.  The GPS was mostly ignored as the coordinates pointed to a spot that probably wouldn't conceal a geocache well.  A couple of circles around eventually brought about another bit of inspiration.  A-ha!  There the cache was!  Retrieving it was a fairly interesting process.  Very nice!  With the log signed and all returned as found, I walked back to the car.  The GPS indicated that further caching awaited.  However, after the amount of hiking earlier (and the potential encounter with coyote), I opted to call the day complete.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I was sitting at home doing not much of anything, when all of a sudden my email pinged. New cache! I hurriedly looked to see where it was, and wouldn't you know it? It was in the place I was in very recently...Moberly! Well, not long after, my email pinged again. Another in Moberly! It pinged again...and again...and AGAIN! All told, I saw eight caches pop up! 

There was no way I was going to let them slide, so I messaged dphickey and asked him if he wanted to go on an epic FTF run with me. At first he said he couldn't go. I knew I was going anyway, so I told him I'd check as I got closer to Columbia. Sure enough, when I got close to town, he said he was able and ready to go! I picked him up and we took off north to Moberly!

This was the second cache of the evening. We had a good idea where the cache should have been...that much is certain. Fate, however, decided to play with us. Our GPSr's bouncing between three trees, we couldn't quite get a lock on things. I searched what I felt was the likely spot, but came up with nothing. I like night caching, but caching in the dark adds difficulty to the search, sometimes making an easy hide a lot harder. Oh well...better luck next time!

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">After the FTF on Joe Cool we made our way to ground zero for this cache.  My GPSr kept bouncing between 3 trees, and A&amp;T settled near one of the three.  We search and searched with our flashlights but found no sign.  I expanded my search area as A&amp;T re-examined 3 different spots we searched but again nothing.  It was just too dark for this one.   Now we know how Charlie Brown feels when Lucy pulls the football at the last second......   We will try again.</groundspeak:text>

The main goal of the day was to simply enjoy myself doing what I really love doing...caching! Along the way, though, any cacher worth their salt would take in the awesome sights, which is exactly what I did! I gotta say, this area of the state is quite beautiful! I was not alone, having the spirits of cachers past tagging along, which added to the fun. Okay, I was kidding about the last part, LOL.

This cache was one of the caches I had the privilege of finding. Thanks for placing this cache for everyone, myself included, to enjoy! TNLN/SL TFTC!

   <groundspeak:short_description html="True">This is a nice small park with a nice lake and picnic tables and a neat bridge that crosses over the lake. Be sure to read the information on left as you get onto the bridge from the parking lot. The cache is should be easy to get to its on flat ground.</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This cache is part of the Peanuts Gang series in Rothwell Park and Lion's Beuth park. I have chosen the area because there is many areas you can park and still get to more than one cache by walking and then can get back into your vehicle and park again to get the next set of caches. You can also if you want walk or bike the nice trails in the area to get to most of the caches. There are also many things to do in the park, plan to bring the family and stay for more enjoyment after your cache adventure that will take you to many areas of the park including around the lake which will give you good views. If you do bring your kids please watch them when around vehicle used areas and the lake caches are not next to the water and you will have several feet if they get away from you. Most to all the cache should not take long to find depending on your expertise.V1p3rx and I have worked to make the series fun and not finding the same old thing over and over. You will find a couple different styles of hides and also one that is maybe not be the expected way to retrieve the cache from the rest of the series. Stealth may be required due to being close to trails, or areas people may visit. We have attempted to give you geocover in all areas but it is a park. Please make sure the cache is hidden well when you place it back into its hiding spot. There is a archery range in the area so use caution even though caches are not placed in the area of the archery. Hope you enjoy the area and caches available in the park and this series.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charles (Sparky) Monroe Schulz was born on November 22nd, 1922 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, but grow up in St. Paul Minnesota at the age of 77 he passed away on February 12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 2000 in Santa Rosa, California. Schulz first comic strip was called &lt;em&gt;Li’l Folks and ran from June 1947-January 1950 in the&lt;/em&gt; St. Paul Pioneer Press. In Li’l Folks was the first time Schulz used the name Charlie Brown and he created a dog that also looked much like Snoopy. In May of 1948 Schulz sold the first of his one panel drawing to The Saturday Evening Post. After his Li’l Folks comic strip was dropped in the 1950’s, Schulz went to United Feature Syndicated with the one panel Li’I Folks. Interested in his one panel comic, However Schulz had developed a normal four panel strip and at that time and United Feature Syndicated became interested and decided to publish a four panel comic. Peanuts made its debut on October 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt;, 1950, in seven different newspapers. The popular weekly Sunday page made its first appearance on January 6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 1952. When the Peanuts comic strip was on top, it was published every day in 2,600 papers in 75 countries, 21 languages. In almost 50 years the Peanuts comic strip was produced Schulz drew nearly 18,000 strips. Between the comic strips, merchandise, product endorsement produced revenues of more than 1 billion per year. Schulz’s estimated earrings was 30-40 million annually. The Peanuts comic strip only once why Schulz was alive have reshowings when Schulz went on vacation for five-weeks to celebrate his 75&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; birthday. Schulz never had assistants creating the strip and refused to hire an inker or letterer. On December 14&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; 1999 Schulz announced his retirement due to having several small strokes and a blocked aorta. It was later discovered he had colon cancer that had metastasized. Once Schulz started chemotherapy he was unable to see clearly. Schulz on February 12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 2000 died in his sleep around 9:45 P.M. from colon cancer. The last original Peanuts comic strip was produced the next day on Sunday, February 13&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;. Charles Monroe Schulz is buried in Pleasant Hill Cemetery in Sebastopol, California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:1.6;"&gt;Marcie-Marcie's first appearance was on July 20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:1.6;"&gt;, 1971, however she was not named until October 11&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:1.6;"&gt;, 1971. She was last seen on January 2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:1.6;"&gt;, 2000 comic strip. Marcie made her first appearance on television in There's No Time For Love, Charlie Brown in 1973. In the TV series Your in the Super Bowl, Charlie Brown Marcie's given name was Johnson, however she was never given a last name in the comic strip, Schulz never gave her an official last name.  Marcie and Peppermint Patty were good friends. Marcie called Peppermint Patty "Sir", why Peppermint Patty referred to Marcie as "dorky" or when talking to others as "My wired friend from camp".   Marcie is a look alike character. In the 1968 Schulz created a character named Clara that had the same appearance as Marcie did when she was created in 1971.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:1.6;"&gt;When Geocaching please respect and follow the rules of the park.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Park is open to the public daily from 5:00 a.m.-11:00 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not damage any of the parks property, tress, or other wildlife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope you enjoy the park and its amenities. &lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I was sitting at home doing not much of anything, chatting with dphickey about this and that, when he mentioned that he was thinking about a caching run up to Moberly. He wanted to avenge some DNF's, find some new caches and go for a FTF! Well, we teamed up to go accomplish these very goals. I needed a couple he had and he needed a couple I had, so with mutual goals, we set off!

This was the final cache we stopped at for the day, and since dphickey was the FTF, this one was all me. He wandered off as I began to search the logical spot. After a little looking, I found that container! Neat placement! I signed the log and put everything back as it was.

Thanks for the fun cache! TNLN/SL TFTC!

FTF LOG:  Rainy Sunday cache run.   Sitting at home with a house full of kids I was beginning to get grumpy.  I logged on to Geocaching.com and browsed around and noticed that there was a cache in Moberly that had not been found yet.   FTF run?   Why not.  Asked the wife if she wanted to go for a drive and after completing a few errands we were off.   She relaxed with a book in the car on the way to Moberly and I planned on a few caches after getting a FTF.   Once we arrived at the park we admred the pretty scenery and then I put the rain coat on and made my way across the bridge.  I noticed a pretty little waterfall, took some pictures and then made my way to GZ.   After arriving at GZ I spotted the cache right off, but the approach was not clear.   How to reach the cache without getting completely soaked?  Finally I just dived in and pushed through to find a blank log... awesome FTF.   Signed the log, replaced the cache and made my way back to the car.  TFTC</groundspeak:text>

   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Over the last few years our family has had events of joy and sorrow that have called us back to the area. Every time, our extended family takes over this establishment  and the common room at breakfast is more like the family kitchen on a holiday morning when everyone is home.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
On this particular occasion, the subject of Geocaching had come up among a number of us and we had noticed that there was a shortage of caches within close proximity. This is our attempt to begin to remedy that issue.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Our Congratulations to Keynotes for the First To Find on this!.&lt;br /&gt;

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Out caching with Trekto on Out Of Town Tuesday.  Today we traveled to Moberly Missouri and Mexico Missouri.  We picked up over 20 caches with only one DNF.
We stopped at each and every cache and signed each and every log.  Thanks to all of the CO's for placing these caches.

Was in the area with Cribbage Witch - On our frequent route from St. Louis to St Joseph Area and back through KC to visit with the Folks in Maysville and the kids in KC.  We decided to pick up a few caches to give ourselves time to stretch.    Even though the trip was about double the length, Geocaching seemed to make it feel it went twice as fast.    Thanks for putting these out to make our trip more enjoyable today.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">wrenberlin and I made the trek to Iowa for another state badge as neither of us had that state. Rainy drive there, snowy drive back. I have family ties to Ottumwa so we concentrated our caches in the area for the most part. After having lunch, caching, visiting grandparents and all around enjoying ourselves, it was time to head back ... in a snow storm ... in the dark ... going 30 MPH on the highway. Needless to say we stopped for the night in Kirksville, MO and decided to local cache in the snow and it turned out to be very fun!

nice and easy grab for a snowy caching day! TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">November Ghost and myself + the geo-pibble decided this Saturday was a good day to find a cache in the great state of Iowa. Yes, that would be the same day a snowstorm was predicted to blow through. Despite logic, our adventurous streak prevailed, and we left from Columbia, MO, early in the day to visit Ottumwa, IA, where November Ghost has family roots. Ottumwa is quite charming! I learned how delicious a canteen lunch is while overhearing the locals discussing the brewing snow. Still un-phased by the talk of ferocious flurries, we spent the afternoon finding many fine caches. Our trip included a visit to Ghost’s past and a test of courage involving climbing up the slippery branches of a tree in the rain. You bet we exchanged some high fives after tackling that one. Around 5 or 6, it finally dawned on us that there was supposed to be some inclement weather on the way. Still, we dilly-dallied at a diner before finally getting out on the road as the sun was setting. Did I mention that I’m from the south, and that I’d never driven through snow before? November Ghost was behind the wheel… but that doesn’t mean he could actually see the road. And neither could I. I don’t think I’ve ever been that terrified due to weather. Now I know what those bumps on the sides of the lane are for! Driving blind proved to be much too stressful, so we stopped in Kirksville, MO for the night (and I found my first cache in the snow!) We made it home safe and sound on Sunday morning, and with a hearty respect for Mother Nature. Many thanks to all of the cachers who placed the hides we found on our trip!

Sunday morning, I woke up to a lovely blanket of snow and took the geo-pibble for a walk in it. Turns out, she loves snow! After a morning meetup at the golden arches for coffee, November Ghost and I took the jeep out to make some fresh tracks through the field of white. We found this cache with ease, signed the log, and continued on our way home. Thanks for the smiley!</groundspeak:text>

County: Randolph, Missouri
Delorme Grid: MO-030

Day 2 of my Midwest Journey to Geowoodstock XII from Des Moines, IA.  Today I started in Ottumwa, IA with some foggy weather and got into some rather stormy conditions as I made my way into Missouri.  Eventually I punched through a line of thunderstorms while moving west from Edina to Kirksville.  The rest of the day was quite delightful and the weather kept getting better and better before ending in Columbia, MO.  Most of my good friends going to GWS were well on their way to the event and I had hoped to see some on the journey, but I wound up not crossing paths with anyone though I evidently crossed paths with some of my Maryland friends near Macon or Moberly today.  Lots of fun caches to be had today!

Typical P&amp;G style of cache.  Not a whole lot happening in the immediate vicinity during my mid-afternoon visit.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I think there must be one of these types of caches in every town. I guessed what type it would be by looking at a map. I spotted the hiding place from over a mile a way, but there were lingering muggles everywhere. Eventually, there were just two, workers who seemed more intent on cleaning out the beer bottles and cans from the back of their truck than trying to figure out what I was doing. This was by far the noisiest and most difficult of all of it's type that I've tried to retrieve. It really added character and challenge to the cache.</groundspeak:text>

We're on our way home to see what's happening.. We need to be home, and prepare for the Veteran's 4th Annual, Lighted Christmas Parade, in Vinton, IA., the Thursday evening (6 PM)(it's DARK), before Thanksgiving.. (The VFW and AmVets got this Parade started four years ago).. Our Veterans Foreign Wars (VFW), American Veterans (AmVets), American Legion, and Vinton's Vol. Fire Dept., all get together for this Parade.. LOTS of business owners put in their lighted "floats", etc. Really a VERY Pretty Parade, with all the Christmas lighted entries.. We even have some antique cars and trucks, in the parade.....
BTW, we want to THANK YOU, for your Cache(s) and maybe one day we'll BCNU down the road..

### **STATUS UPDATE NEEDED** ###

-------------

Greetings, 

I hate to pop in here like this but from reading the last note or two, I see this cache might need a little attention. It is worrisome when a cache with a successful find history has a string of DNF's. The geocaching community would like to know how it's going here. Is your cache still here, is it being worked on, that sort of thing. When you get a chance, please log onto your page and give everyone an update by posting a note to your cache page.

If it is not disabled already, I will temporarily disable your cache   to give you an opportunity to stop by and check on your cache.

If you haven't had time to check on it by my next check I'll go ahead and archive it then.
If you decide that this project has reached its end you can archive it now to remove it from the active cache database.

When everything is OK again, please remember to enable your cache and post an "Owner Maintenance" log on your cache page. This log removes the "needs maintenance" and allows your cache to be shown in the search results of Pocket Queries. Don't let your cache be filtered out unnecessarily in Pocket Queries by forgetting to reset the attribute!
I want to thank you for the time that you have taken to contribute to Geocaching in the past and I am looking forward to hopefully seeing your cache up and running in the near future.

HOW TO RESPOND IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS
Respond by posting a new Note. Go to the cache page in question, and click on Log Your Visit. Select "Post Note" as the log type, and enter your message. Doing that, I'll know exactly what cache your message pertains to, which will speed the communication process.
If you're reading this as an email, don't reply to the sending address. It won't reach me. Follow the contact instructions above.

Was in the area with Cribbage Witch - On our frequent route from St. Louis to St Joseph Area and back through KC to visit with the Folks in Maysville and the kids in KC.  We decided to pick up a few caches to give ourselves time to stretch.    Even though the trip was about double the length, Geocaching seemed to make it feel it went twice as fast.    Thanks for putting these out to make our trip more enjoyable today.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">wrenberlin and I made the trek to Iowa for another state badge as neither of us had that state. Rainy drive there, snowy drive back. I have family ties to Ottumwa so we concentrated our caches in the area for the most part. After having lunch, caching, visiting grandparents and all around enjoying ourselves, it was time to head back ... in a snow storm ... in the dark ... going 30 MPH on the highway. Needless to say we stopped for the night in Kirksville, MO and decided to local cache in the snow and it turned out to be very fun!

quick and easy smiley to log on the snow trip back to Columbia ... curious as to what was in the backpack ...hmmmm?</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">November Ghost and myself + the geo-pibble decided this Saturday was a good day to find a cache in the great state of Iowa. Yes, that would be the same day a snowstorm was predicted to blow through. Despite logic, our adventurous streak prevailed, and we left from Columbia, MO, early in the day to visit Ottumwa, IA, where November Ghost has family roots. Ottumwa is quite charming! I learned how delicious a canteen lunch is while overhearing the locals discussing the brewing snow. Still un-phased by the talk of ferocious flurries, we spent the afternoon finding many fine caches. Our trip included a visit to Ghost’s past and a test of courage involving climbing up the slippery branches of a tree in the rain. You bet we exchanged some high fives after tackling that one. Around 5 or 6, it finally dawned on us that there was supposed to be some inclement weather on the way. Still, we dilly-dallied at a diner before finally getting out on the road as the sun was setting. Did I mention that I’m from the south, and that I’d never driven through snow before? November Ghost was behind the wheel… but that doesn’t mean he could actually see the road. And neither could I. I don’t think I’ve ever been that terrified due to weather. Now I know what those bumps on the sides of the lane are for! Driving blind proved to be much too stressful, so we stopped in Kirksville, MO for the night (and I found my first cache in the snow!) We made it home safe and sound on Sunday morning, and with a hearty respect for Mother Nature. Many thanks to all of the cachers who placed the hides we found on our trip!

Sunday morning, I woke up to a lovely blanket of snow and took the geo-pibble for a walk in it. Turns out, she loves snow! After a morning meetup at the golden arches for coffee, November Ghost and I took the jeep out to make some fresh tracks through the field of white. There was a backpack on the ground near the cache. And some plastic grocery bags filled with brown lumps. Yeah... thanks for the smiley anyway!</groundspeak:text>

This day seemed replete with recent memories.  Both Atomic Goat's Breath and I had visited the train viewing platform at different times in the past; our return ensured that a new cache would be found.  [;)]  Another visitor stayed in his truck and didn't seem to pay mind to our searching around the area.  Ideas on hiding places were tossed back and forth (one with a certain wry humor), and the cache was discovered in good shape.  We returned to the car just in time as a trio of new arrivals soon set upon their own explorations.

Took nothing, left nothing.</groundspeak:text>

Weather prediction was sunny and 50's for the day after Christmas.  I had not been out for a major cache run since July so I got permission from the muggle wife and our adventure was set.  We left before dawn and the plan was to return after sunset.  This was cache 22 for the day.  
  I was at this spot previously for a cache back in 2011 when I made the trip to MOGA.   I guess A&amp;T DNFd that cache on that same day but he was able to find this cache today.   Coords were off about 20 feet to towards the latrines...  All three of our GPSr zeroed out there.   Signed log team TAD. TFTC.</groundspeak:text>

This cache really lived up to it's name. It took us quite a while to find. GZ led us between the gas tank and the womens' outhouse. The cache was about 20 or 30 feet away. It wasn't enough just to search for the cache. We had to walk around and enjoy the sights. A trains horn blew in the distance, but after waiting a while we gave up on seeing it and moved on, but the train was down the line. TFTC

   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JOHN MATTHEW BRENNEMAN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEPT. 15,1975 – MAR. 11,2014&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John was born into a family with an older sister Julie, an older brother Jay and  two surprised parents Jim and Judy.  We thought Judy had the flu, not morning sickness.  Given the family tradition, unknowingly established, his first name would have to start with “J” thus John.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John was born and raised in the small town of Santa Maria CA.  He attended Miller Street School for Kindergarten, 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; and 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; Grades.  He started 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; Grade at St. Mary's Catholic School through the 6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Grade.  Then attended Fesler Junior High School for the 7&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Grades and onto St. Joseph High School for four years and Graduation in 1993. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John was a good boy and was not a hard one to raise, but he did have his moments.  When he was three or four he walked through the living room carrying a screw driver toward his room.  When asked why he replied he was going to take apart his sit and spin. Which he did.  Reassembly was performed later by Dad.  He liked to see how things worked and had an aptitude for mechanical and electrical work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John enjoyed sports and excelled as a Junior Bowler and attended State tournaments with his friends on Rancho Bowl teams.  After he grew up and left home he almost always had two bowling balls in the trunk of his car, in case a bowling opportunity materialized.  He took up throwing the Discus in High School and in his Senior year he went to the California Southern Section CIF finals to qualify for the state tournament and missed qualifying by one slot, they took 9 throwers and John finished 10&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; with his best throw of the season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John was a great person and devoted to his friends and family.  He was not lucky in love.  He wanted the dream, but the women he chose did not. He stayed for 5 years with the first love and finally ended it with no children.  He then married a woman with 3 children and was happy to act as their father for 9 years.  Kayla, Alexis and Kenneth (Bubba) Smart were very much loved by John, and were placed with their biological Dad after his second divorce.  However he did get full custody of his children from that marriage , Emily and Matthew.  His greatest joy was the successes of all 5 of the children and he enjoyed sharing their stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John joined the Army in May of 1999, not wanting to go to college at the time, but looking for training he could use in life, plus the benefits of college subsidies he could use later.  He went to a 9 month Medical Equipment Course and was the honor graduate.  Because of his ability to assimilate and retain information, he was able to not only utilize his high school education to advance him in his class, but also to tutored others who were struggling.  John was sent to Kuwait and then into Iraq as a part of the invasion force in 2003.  He left the Army with an honorable discharge in May 2005, because he did not want to be separated from his family in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John then moved his family from his last Military duty station in San Antonio, TX to Columbia, MO, where he worked for Modern Biomedical Services, Inc. in support of the Moberly Regional Medical Center (MRMC).  He was a Bio-Medical Technician there, repairing and maintaining medical equipment within the hospital complex.  He loved his job and the people he worked with both within Modern Biomedical and MRMC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The friends he met through work and outside work, in his community, were important to him and he was always willing and able to lend a helping hand when needed.  He loved to coach discus and found a small school that could use his help.  He also helped coach his children's teams as they began playing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sports.  He was active in helping his children succeed in school and placed a heavy emphasis on the importance of school in them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the help he provided to others was part of his legacy, their help in working him through the rough parts of his life was also  important. The people that knew him always describe him as happy and cheerful to all.  He was moving his life into a better place after his last divorce and his positive attitude was shining through.  It was a tragedy when a drunk driver, going the wrong way on a divided highway, ended his young life on 11 March 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John made the world around him a better place while he was here and no one can ask more than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

Was in the area with Cribbage Witch - On our frequent route from St. Louis to St Joseph Area and back through KC to visit with the Folks in Maysville and the kids in KC.  We decided to pick up a few caches to give ourselves time to stretch.    Even though the trip was about double the length, Geocaching seemed to make it feel it went twice as fast.    Thanks for putting these out to make our trip more enjoyable today.</groundspeak:text>

Teaming up with Atomic Goat's Breath, we resolved to head north and find whatever caches we encountered on the way!  Our first stop was Moberly.  After locating another cache south of town, this one was next on our list.  The container was readily spotted from the parking area making the find no problem.  Our condolences on your loss; the tree is a nice tribute to your lost coworker.

Day 2 of my Midwest Journey to Geowoodstock XII from Des Moines, IA.  Today I started in Ottumwa, IA with some foggy weather and got into some rather stormy conditions as I made my way into Missouri.  Eventually I punched through a line of thunderstorms while moving west from Edina to Kirksville.  The rest of the day was quite delightful and the weather kept getting better and better before ending in Columbia, MO.  Most of my good friends going to GWS were well on their way to the event and I had hoped to see some on the journey, but I wound up not crossing paths with anyone though I evidently crossed paths with some of my Maryland friends near Macon or Moberly today.  Lots of fun caches to be had today!

Very nice hide, and sorry for your loss.  John was only a few months older than myself and read your memorial on the cache page.  He sounds liek a nice guy and a great loss to the community.  Thank you to John for his service.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I saw this when it first published, but decided not to rush to it "too soon," as it seemed it would be good for a calendar filler. Well, today was that day. Plus I'm trying to get Geowoodstock to be a milestone for me.  Gotta get some numbers before the weekend...

I've always thought a tree is a nice memorial. Something that can be admired more as the years pass.

Thanks for the cache!</groundspeak:text>

In town today for work and couldn't resist a quick find after wrapping things up across the square this afternoon. Pulled up and was back on the road in less than a minute. Only took a moment to find, sign and replace then it was time to head back north to my hotel for the day. TNLNSL. Thanks for the cache!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">wrenberlin and I made the trek to Iowa for another state badge as neither of us had that state. Rainy drive there, snowy drive back. I have family ties to Ottumwa so we concentrated our caches in the area for the most part. After having lunch, caching, visiting grandparents and all around enjoying ourselves, it was time to head back ... in a snow storm ... in the dark ... going 30 MPH on the highway. Needless to say we stopped for the night in Kirksville, MO and decided to local cache in the snow and it turned out to be very fun!

this one required hiking through the snow and getting cold feet! The GPS was bouncing us due to the weather but wrenberlin had the cache in short order ... TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">November Ghost and myself + the geo-pibble decided this Saturday was a good day to find a cache in the great state of Iowa. Yes, that would be the same day a snowstorm was predicted to blow through. Despite logic, our adventurous streak prevailed, and we left from Columbia, MO, early in the day to visit Ottumwa, IA, where November Ghost has family roots. Ottumwa is quite charming! I learned how delicious a canteen lunch is while overhearing the locals discussing the brewing snow. Still un-phased by the talk of ferocious flurries, we spent the afternoon finding many fine caches. Our trip included a visit to Ghost’s past and a test of courage involving climbing up the slippery branches of a tree in the rain. You bet we exchanged some high fives after tackling that one. Around 5 or 6, it finally dawned on us that there was supposed to be some inclement weather on the way. Still, we dilly-dallied at a diner before finally getting out on the road as the sun was setting. Did I mention that I’m from the south, and that I’d never driven through snow before? November Ghost was behind the wheel… but that doesn’t mean he could actually see the road. And neither could I. I don’t think I’ve ever been that terrified due to weather. Now I know what those bumps on the sides of the lane are for! Driving blind proved to be much too stressful, so we stopped in Kirksville, MO for the night (and I found my first cache in the snow!) We made it home safe and sound on Sunday morning, and with a hearty respect for Mother Nature. Many thanks to all of the cachers who placed the hides we found on our trip!

Sunday morning, I woke up to a lovely blanket of snow and took the geo-pibble for a walk in it. Turns out, she loves snow! After a morning meetup at the golden arches for coffee, November Ghost and I took the jeep out to make some fresh tracks through the field of white. Finding this cache took a few, but with frozen hands we signed the log. Thanks!</groundspeak:text>

A bit of walking around left the two of us puzzled.  Fortunately, the cache container was spotted not long thereafter.

A return visit on the way home saw a more extensive exploration that included many somewhat logical assertions.  Alas, the cache was not to be found this day.</groundspeak:text>

Now I only have 5 to go, but they will have to wait.  Also, filled a couple more dates on the calendar and added a few more counties in north central Missouri to the map.  Drove over 700 miles through rain, snow and sun, but it was all worth it for the joy of more smilies!  Thanks to all the CO’s for creating and maintaining these hides for my enjoyment, especially the old ones!  Cache on!

Another quick find, another MO county.  Thanks!!</groundspeak:text>

ScrapLadyS needed a ride-along buddy to go see her son pitch some college baseball, so what better than to make it a georoad trip?  We planned a few dozen caches, but time and distance prevented us from doing all of them.  No worries.  Better to have too many than too few.  This cache was one that we picked up during the weekend.  Thank you for placing it!

Some of these may be logged out of order due to some weird happening with the app.  They aren't in order there.  O.o</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">wrenberlin and I made the trek to Iowa for another state badge as neither of us had that state. Rainy drive there, snowy drive back. I have family ties to Ottumwa so we concentrated our caches in the area for the most part. After having lunch, caching, visiting grandparents and all around enjoying ourselves, it was time to head back ... in a snow storm ... in the dark ... going 30 MPH on the highway. Needless to say we stopped for the night in Kirksville, MO and decided to local cache in the snow and it turned out to be very fun!

perfect for a snowy and cold day! TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">November Ghost and myself + the geo-pibble decided this Saturday was a good day to find a cache in the great state of Iowa. Yes, that would be the same day a snowstorm was predicted to blow through. Despite logic, our adventurous streak prevailed, and we left from Columbia, MO, early in the day to visit Ottumwa, IA, where November Ghost has family roots. Ottumwa is quite charming! I learned how delicious a canteen lunch is while overhearing the locals discussing the brewing snow. Still un-phased by the talk of ferocious flurries, we spent the afternoon finding many fine caches. Our trip included a visit to Ghost’s past and a test of courage involving climbing up the slippery branches of a tree in the rain. You bet we exchanged some high fives after tackling that one. Around 5 or 6, it finally dawned on us that there was supposed to be some inclement weather on the way. Still, we dilly-dallied at a diner before finally getting out on the road as the sun was setting. Did I mention that I’m from the south, and that I’d never driven through snow before? November Ghost was behind the wheel… but that doesn’t mean he could actually see the road. And neither could I. I don’t think I’ve ever been that terrified due to weather. Now I know what those bumps on the sides of the lane are for! Driving blind proved to be much too stressful, so we stopped in Kirksville, MO for the night (and I found my first cache in the snow!) We made it home safe and sound on Sunday morning, and with a hearty respect for Mother Nature. Many thanks to all of the cachers who placed the hides we found on our trip!

Sunday morning, I woke up to a lovely blanket of snow and took the geo-pibble for a walk in it. Turns out, she loves snow! After a morning meetup at the golden arches for coffee, November Ghost and I took the jeep out to make some fresh tracks through the field of white. This park-n-grab was a fun find today. Thanks!</groundspeak:text>

Was in the area with Cribbage Witch - On our frequent route from St. Louis to St Joseph Area and back through KC to visit with the Folks in Maysville and the kids in KC.  We decided to pick up a few caches to give ourselves time to stretch.    Even though the trip was about double the length, Geocaching seemed to make it feel it went twice as fast.    Thanks for putting these out to make our trip more enjoyable today.</groundspeak:text>

Weather prediction was sunny and 50's for the day after Christmas.  I had not been out for a major cache run since July so I got permission from the muggle wife and our adventure was set.  We left before dawn and the plan was to return after sunset.  This was cache 3 for the day.  
  I've been wanting to do this cache since it first published.   This is the type of hide I enjoy.  When we arrived at the parking spot I spotted what I thought was the spot but the GPSr took me to an even bigger tree that must have been beautiful before when it was in it's glory.  We retreived the cache and signed our team name TAD and were off to another cache. TFTC</groundspeak:text>

Day 2 of my Midwest Journey to Geowoodstock XII from Des Moines, IA.  Today I started in Ottumwa, IA with some foggy weather and got into some rather stormy conditions as I made my way into Missouri.  Eventually I punched through a line of thunderstorms while moving west from Edina to Kirksville.  The rest of the day was quite delightful and the weather kept getting better and better before ending in Columbia, MO.  Most of my good friends going to GWS were well on their way to the event and I had hoped to see some on the journey, but I wound up not crossing paths with anyone though I evidently crossed paths with some of my Maryland friends near Macon or Moberly today.  Lots of fun caches to be had today!

Nice bold hide!  Rarely see one hidden so "open" as this.  I enjoyed it and think it deserves a FP.</groundspeak:text>

Heading north from Columbia, I drove along highway 63 singing along to the radio.  It was yet another day that required fulfillment for the geocaching challenge, and all prior attempts took me either west or south.  A new cache in Moberly prompted the change in compass direction.  Parking was easily found nearby; however, ice on the pavement brought forth caution.  Approaching the coordinates, a sizable tree stump was admired.  This must have been one large tree in its day!  The cache was spotted soon thereafter and quickly retrieved.  A new signature was added to the log book, and the container was replaced as found with a little bit of additional geocover.  Thanks for an interesting hide!

Took nothing, left nothing.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">This was more of an adventure than expected! The journey to Moberly was uneventful,  even pretty with the ice on trees and grasses but not the roadway.

When I found the cache, however, ice did become an issue!! It was very firmly iced into its spot!

I made several trips to my car, trying various objects to scrape off or dislodge ice and cache. In the end, it was my trusty walking stick that levered it out! You know the quote, "Give me a lever and a place to stand and I shall move the world." Which is what I did. 

I took the cache to a nearby table to sign. I took the candy, not a good cache item! And left one of the tools that is useful, just not for ice removal.

Thanks for the {*FTF*} and the really cool stump! When things thaw out, this might need better cover. If I were a kid, that location would be a playground!
