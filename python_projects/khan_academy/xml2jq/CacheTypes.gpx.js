I parked just next to the gate, suited up and prepared to undertake this Wherigo.  A truck approached just as I was about to cross inquiring if everything was alright.  Reassurances were made, and, once the coast was clear, I again embarked for the campground.\n\nThree deer were grazing near the top of the hill and starting point for the Wherigo. They were amazingly calm as I pulled out the GPS and began following its instructions.  The cartridge was very well put together and many familiar faces were spied as locations were visited.  One point brought me very close to the deer who then ran off.  As their hooves clacked against the pavement, I could only help but feel transported into the era of the Wherigo.  Very cool indeed.\n\nEventually, a final location was given.  A cautious entry was made into the wood as the sun had just set and nightfall was upon me.  The cache was found in great shape keeping out of sight.  A lengthy signing commenced, and all was replaced as discovered.  Thanks for a memorable milestone and a great adventure!\n\nTook nothing, left nothing."

It was fun, and everyone will be happy to know I didn't hit any of the bystander's. I kind of wish I would have started it all over again to see what would happen if I didn't shoot one of the outlaw's. I nailed them all on the first shoot. Kind of funny, was heading to the starting point and just following the arrow. Dumb!! But I stumbled on to one of the kid's caches, At least that's what I think it was.\n\nThanks for a really neat cache. I really enjoyed it. I will have to upload the pic of my ringing the bell. .

A couple of challenges caches came out that required one to find a lot of counties between the Mexican and Canadian borders, and another between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans.  We discussed a variety of options and finely had some dates and a plan in place.  Our trip consisted of driving from Minnesota to Jacksonville, FL; over to New Orleans, LA; and then back north following the Mississippi River.  We managed to complete the three primary goals of this mission plus some secondary ones.  My car ended up with 4225 miles on it.  We found caches in 123 counties and 14 states. I ended up with 293 finds and 18 DNFs over the nine days.  All in all in was a great trip with a great friend.\n\nToday we started in Hernando, MS and drove 489 miles to Bloomsdale, MO for the night.  We found 30 caches and 4 DNFs in 18 counties.  We had to start getting picky with our caches today.  Almost done with the trip and we still are a ways from home.  Given what was on the agenda, we actually managed to find 6 different icons in 6 different states today.  That qualified me for a challenge cache I signed a few months ago.  I like it when a plan comes together.  We took a meandering route in order to hit some high priority targets and made it to a safe spot to spend the night.\n\nThis cache was the entire reason for a detour to Martin.  It was not on our way, but a webcam is enough to draw us over here.  We figured out where to stand and had to us cell phone technology in order to get a picture.  I am sure glad it is the weekend.  This is our fifth one of the trip.  It makes me smile.  Pun intended.\n\nTFTWebcam"

After that we headed south across the Ohio River to Kentucky and down one side of the Mississippi River to Memphis for a rib dinner and a pitcher of Ghost River beer on Beale Street, and then back up the other side grabbing every county along the way. Although we each ended up with slightly different numbers based on previous individual trips, our totals included 7 states, 81 counties, 4 webcams, 17 virtuals, 3 earthcaches, 128 blue squigglies, and we were asked to do a bit part in a movie with a crew from London, England filming the Blue Flash roller coaster. We included GCC6 \u2018Turkey Run Stash\u2019 in Indiana to Tennessee\u2019s first GC132 \u2018LPS001\u2019and filled several Jasmer spots while grabbing a few other older caches too. On Saturday we grabbed six of the states; Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi, Arkansas, and Missouri. On Sunday we chased tornados up I-57 through Illinois and saw three overturned semi\u2019s, plus a camper and utility trailer flipped on the highway and finally a large debris field made from several barns that crossed the highway ahead of us, but we still got our caches! We saw everything from bald eagles to a leopard, and waterfalls to an Elvis impersonator, and had quite a few smileys in between with an FTF in Tennessee thrown in to boot. Whew\u2026.\nThanks to all the cache owners for placing and maintaining these for others to find."

I contacted The Musician and sicked him on the job. He saw where the link was supposed to be pointing and he hunted until he found the UTM webcams. So by the time we got to campus he was telling us what he was seeing as he clicked through the cameras. Finally he named two things he could see and we headed toward the fountain until he said he could see us. We were all looking at the wrong camera but I think it made a very unique photo with all of us waving at the wrong camera. Thanks of the cache and the challenge.
