   <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;The cache is NOT at the posted coordinates. I developed this cache series to share some facts about insects. Most of the answers can be easily googled. Some may take a little additional logic to get right. I hope fellow geocachers find this to be a fun and worthwhile series.&lt;/p&gt;
This cache is of a small size hidden along a roadway in mid-Missouri - no place special or particularly scenic. If nothing else, consider it an opportunity for a number boost!</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;To find the coordinates to this cache, you will research answers to questions about the insect order Hymenoptera – bees, ants, and wasps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final location is at N38 5A.BCD W92 0E.AFG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choose the answer that is correct to fill in the coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;A. The Hymenoptera could be considered to be most advanced of all insect orders, due to the evolution of eusociality in the ants, bees and wasps. What is the hallmark of eusociality?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;cooperative brood care = 4&lt;br /&gt;
overlapping generations of adults = 5&lt;br /&gt;
reproductive and non-reproductive caste system = 6&lt;br /&gt;
all of the above = 7&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;B. What is a “cow killer”?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;ant = 0&lt;br /&gt;
bee = 1&lt;br /&gt;
wasp = 2&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;C. “Phase IV” was a movie made in 1974. What hymenopterans are the “villains” in this film?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;bees = 3&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;ants = 4&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;wasps = 5&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;sawflies = 6&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;D. Larvae of &lt;i&gt;Perga affinis&lt;/i&gt;, an Australian sawfly, uses what tactic as a defense against predators?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;”spitting” an odorous green liquid = 6&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;ejecting small stinging hairs = 7&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;inflicting bites with their 2 inch mandibles = 8&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;pulling their heads into a shell = 9&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;E. The so-called “killer bee”, a.k.a the Africanized honey bee, &lt;i&gt;Apis mellifera scutellata&lt;/i&gt;, was accidentally released into the wild in the western hemisphere in what country?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Cuba = 2&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Panama = 3&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Barbados = 4&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Brazil = 5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;F. Honey bees are one of the most economically significant insects on earth. In addition to their production of honey, wax, pollen, and their impact on pollination of flowering plants, one of their products can be used to make an alcoholic beverage known as?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;kombucha = 2&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;mead = 3&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;sambuca = 4&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;nalewka = 5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
G = 0&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;div&gt;You are looking for a camouflaged pill bottle. I boiled and washed out the bottle myself - so no worries on the pharmaceutical residues!&lt;/div&gt;

Ah, the last cache for the day.  There'd be plenty of time to return home and relax . . . provided the hunt was short and sweet.  [:P]  Parking was easily obtained close to the coordinates, and a short walk saw me there quickly.  Some manner of looking about was needed to procure this particular stash.  A keen eye spotted the container, and all was good.  I contemplated finding a couple more west of Columbia; however, there were tasks awaiting that could not be put off . . . like dinner . . .

Thank you for all the work you've put into researching and publishing this series.  While my logs centered around the journey and discovery, learning more about the insect world around us was stupendous!</groundspeak:text>

Out caching after the "Battle of Binder Redux - CITO 2016" event on a gorgeous Saturday. The event went off without a hitch and the conditions couldn't have been better. The great weather continued into the afternoon, when it was at this point that I decided to go after these new caches.

I saw one pop up the night before, but I was too pooped to go after it, having already traveled to Marshall, Sedalia, Jeff City and back home. No matter...another cacher got the well-earned FTF. Early this morning, however, I noticed five more caches publish. Hmmm...better get to work on them. I got all but one solved, and that one was quickly rectified after I got a tip from the cache owner. Solving them was all I could do, though, because I had an event to attend.

After the event was over and we were heading back home, I noticed that the caches had remained unfound. What the heck, I thought...let's go for them! Best case scenario, I get a few FTF's and cache on a gorgeous day...worst case, I still get to cache on a gorgeous day! So, I loaded up the GPSr and scooted off down the road.

This cache was the first of the new caches I went after. As I neared the area of ground zero, I kinda had an idea where it might be. I was wrong just a bit. The second place I looked held the container. I opened it up and was pleased to find a blank log, which I dutifully marred in the FTF spot. I put it back and set out for the next one.

Thanks for placing this cache for everyone, myself included, to enjoy! TNLN/SL TFTC!

Yes, we know where our towels are...

This cache is of a small size hidden along a roadway in mid-Missouri - no place special or particularly scenic. If nothing else, consider it an opportunity for a number boost!</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;To find the coordinates to this cache, you will research answers to questions about the insect order Lepidoptera – moths and butterflies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final location is at N38 5A.BCA W92 0D.CEF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choose the answer that is correct to fill in the coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;A. &lt;i&gt;Actias luna&lt;/i&gt; is a well-known moth with a range that covers nearly all of eastern North America. Their caterpillars are somewhat finicky about what they eat. Which of the following best describes the type of host plant used most often by this beautiful moth?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;orchids = 6&lt;br /&gt;
aquatic plants = 7&lt;br /&gt;
trees = 8&lt;br /&gt;
corn = 9&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;B. The gypsy moth, &lt;i&gt;Lymantria dispar dispar&lt;/i&gt;, destroys approximately 1 million acres of hardwoods each year. This pest was deliberately introduced into North America by an amateur entomologist. What was the probable reason for this?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;as a biological control effort against alligatorweed = 2&lt;br /&gt;
as part of research into silk production = 3&lt;br /&gt;
as a food source for horses = 4&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;C. “The Butterfly Effect” is not just an Ashton Kutcher movie about time travel, but also a concept derived from and used to explain which theory?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Theory of Evolution = 6&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Chaos Theory = 7&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Theory of Relativity = 8&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Theory of Competitive Advantage = 9&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;D. &lt;i&gt;Papilio glaucus&lt;/i&gt;, the Eastern Tiger Swallowtail, is one of only a few organisms on earth that can exhibit both male and female characteristics in the same individual, due to genetic mosaicism. What is the term for this phenomenon?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;allelopathy = 2&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;mutualism = 3&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;lepidopterism = 4&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;gynandromorphy = 5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;E. What is the most likely cause of death for a Monarch butterfly?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;ingestion of Bt corn pollen = 2&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;being struck by cars = 3&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;predation in the wild = 4&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;forest fires = 5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;F. Micropterigoidea is a superfamily within the order Lepidoptera. Moths within this superfamily are considered to be the most primitive of all Lepidoptera. What is different about Micropterigoids?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;asexual reproduction = 6&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;three pair of wings = 7&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;raptorial forelegs = 8&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;functioning mandibles = 9&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;You are looking for a camouflaged pill bottle. I boiled and washed out the bottle myself - so no worries on the pharmaceutical residues!&lt;/div&gt;

The rough country road wound around wooded banks until I drove out into the open.  Whew!  Telltale signs of agriculture then surged on either side of the car heralding my arrival.  Birds sang, and clouds danced high up in the sky.

. . . Perhaps approaching the coordinates wasn't really that grandiose.  [:P]  In any case, I arrived with some measure of trepidation.  Knowing when to have an excuse ready is the hallmark of an experienced geocacher.  With GPS pointing the way, the hunt was on!

Searching for this bugger was tricky.  I poked, prodded and generally annoyed everything within a twenty-five foot radius.  An idea struck, and, feeling around, the cache was in hand.  Nicely done yet again!  The cache owner kept me on my toes during this outing; I like that.  With a sign and replace, I continued on.</groundspeak:text>

Out caching after the "Battle of Binder Redux - CITO 2016" event on a gorgeous Saturday. The event went off without a hitch and the conditions couldn't have been better. The great weather continued into the afternoon, when it was at this point that I decided to go after these new caches.

I saw one pop up the night before, but I was too pooped to go after it, having already traveled to Marshall, Sedalia, Jeff City and back home. No matter...another cacher got the well-earned FTF. Early this morning, however, I noticed five more caches publish. Hmmm...better get to work on them. I got all but one solved, and that one was quickly rectified after I got a tip from the cache owner. Solving them was all I could do, though, because I had an event to attend.

After the event was over and we were heading back home, I noticed that the caches had remained unfound. What the heck, I thought...let's go for them! Best case scenario, I get a few FTF's and cache on a gorgeous day...worst case, I still get to cache on a gorgeous day! So, I loaded up the GPSr and scooted off down the road.

This cache was the second of the new caches I went after. As I drove up, I had a fairly good idea where this one might be. After poking around a minute or two, I found the well-cammoed container. Opening it up, I was greeted by another clean log sheet! I scribbled my name on the FTF spot and put it back and set out for the next one.

Thanks for placing this cache for everyone, myself included, to enjoy! TNLN/SL TFTC!

Yes, we know where our towels are...

Caches are in a final location that is no place special or particularly scenic. If nothing else, consider it an opportunity for a number boost!</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;To find the coordinates to this cache, you will research answers to questions about the insect order Orthoptera – grasshoppers, crickets, and katydids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final location is at N38 5A.BAC W92 0D.EEB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choose the answer that is correct to fill in the coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;A. What kind of insect is the bad guy in "The Miracle of the Gulls"?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;grasshopper = 6&lt;br /&gt;
cricket = 8&lt;br /&gt;
mole cricket = 8&lt;br /&gt;
katydid = 9&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;B. One of the following has never been a common name of an orthopteran. But which?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Crackling Locust = 0&lt;br /&gt;
Furnace Heat Lubber = 1&lt;br /&gt;
Robust Monkey Grasshopper = 2&lt;br /&gt;
Jerusalem Cricket = 3&lt;br /&gt;
Great Grig = 4&lt;br /&gt;
Jade-striped Sylph= 5&lt;br /&gt;
Carlinian Snapper= 6&lt;br /&gt;
Carolina Leaf-roller= 6&lt;br /&gt;
Aztec Spur-throat= 8&lt;br /&gt;
Sword-bearing Conehead= 9&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;C. OK, I'm just going to give you this one. But first, I want you to google "Cooloola monster".&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;C = 0&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;D. Under ideal environmental conditions, several generations of &lt;i&gt;Schistocerca gregaria&lt;/i&gt; can be produced in a very short period of time, leading to destructive swarms of this insect that can cover as much as 20% of the earth's land surface. What is the common name of this pest?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Migratory locust = 5&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Rocky Mountain locust = 6&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Desert locust = 7&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Pharoah locust = 8&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;E. Males of a particular type of orthopteran construct exponential horn-shaped burrows. They use these burrows for "singing" to attract a mate, and the sound can reach a peak of 115 dB. What type of insect is this?
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Mormon Cricket = 5
&lt;div&gt;mole cricket = 6
&lt;div&gt;pygmy mole cricket = 7
&lt;div&gt;giant weta = 8&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

Some measure of stealth was apparent upon arrival to this cache.  Saying why might spoil things; suffice it to say, I was quiet and attentive while parking.  A short walk brought me to the coordinates for a swift find, sign and replace.  I left as silently as I had arrived like a whisper on the wind.  The only trace of my visit was a signature.

SUCCESS!

Sometimes you feel like you've earned a cache find. Maybe it's due to a hard hike, an evil hide, avenging multiple DNF's, or even redeeming actual physical hardship to get to it. I think I can apply most of these examples to this one.

I won't bore you with the saga of my previous attempts, as they are there for the world to see below this log. Suffice it to say, when I saw that the cache had been updated and the final moved a bit, I had a renewed hope for finding this cache. Figuring it'd be a safer spot for me to search based on the maintenance log, I asked Trillian if we could go after it, so we stopped by on the way to our son's tennis match at Battle High School. 

I headed to the new spot and began my search. After some looking, I spotted the container. Just in case, I donned a pair of gloves I had in the car (Why didn't I have any in the other vehicle I used the last two times?) and retrieved the container. I opened it up and was happy to see it blank! With a great sense of relief, I signed that FTF spot. I put everything back nicely and then Trillian and I continued our way to Battle.

Thank you, spitoony, for the series and most especially your patience with this cache. A favorite point has most certainly been earned. TNLN/SL

Yes, we know where our towels are...

This sums up my latest attempt at this cache. After hearing the cache is there and with the hint updated, I went to go look for this one again. 

I had maybe searched ten minutes when, upon searching one particular area, I started to feel some stinking sensations on my right hand. I looked down to see about half a dozen large black ants on me, dutifully defending their turf via bites. 

I brushed them off quickly and thought that was that. Heck, I even emailed the cache owner joking about it. Well, it wasn't exactly the end...

Not long after I hit "send" on the email, I began to feel odd with a sense of slight dizziness, coughing, a skin reaction near the bites and the kind of breathing you have after ascending a large hill. Something wasn't right. On that note, I packed it up and sped off toward home.

I got home and Dr. Trillian ordered me to take a couple Benadryl. Slowly things started to get better.

I hated to DNF this cache again, but Mother Nature decided it wasn't my time. Dr. Trillian decided I had better go after the cache in the winter, when the bugs would be dormant. That advice I shall follow.

I offer a hearty congratulations in advance for the FTF'er on this cache. I, however, will wait on this one for a while. No matter what, thanks spitoony for the cache</groundspeak:text>

   <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;The cache is NOT at the posted coordinates. This is part of the second wave of a cache series I’m using to quiz cachers about insects, and hopefully spread some knowledge. Most of the answers can be easily googled. Some may take a little additional logic to get right. I hope fellow geocachers find this to be a fun and worthwhile series.&lt;/p&gt;
Caches are in a final location that is no place special or particularly scenic. If nothing else, consider it an opportunity for a number boost!</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;To find the coordinates to this cache, you will research answers to questions about the insect order Psocodea – barklice, booklice, and "true" lice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final location is at N38 5A.BCD W92 0D.ADE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choose the answer that is correct to fill in the coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;A. The barklice and booklice are tiny, ineffectual creatures that humans rarely come in contact with. What is their primary food?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;paper, books, and ink = 7&lt;br /&gt;
fungi, algae, lichens = 8&lt;br /&gt;
decaying animal matter = 9&lt;br /&gt;
raspberries = 0&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;B. Entomologists once considered the true lice to be a separate order from the booklice and barklice. Being incapable of leaving well-enough alone, though, systematists have reclassified the true lice as being evolutionarily descended from other psocodeans, and thus part of the order. What was the name of the order that formerly contained the true lice?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Phtheraptira = 0&lt;br /&gt;
Phthiraptera = 1&lt;br /&gt;
Phtireptira = 2&lt;br /&gt;
Pthiraphtera = 3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;C. The true lice are obligate parasites of warm-blooded animals. Their hosts include every species of bird and mammal except monotremes, pangolins, bats, and cetaceans. What are monotremes?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Kangaroos and wallabies = 6&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Voles and flying foxes= 5&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Spiny anteaters and the platypus = 0&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Aardvarks and aardwolves= 4&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;D. The human body louse, &lt;i&gt;Pediculus humanus humanus&lt;/i&gt;, vectors the pathogen &lt;i&gt;Rickettsia prowazekii&lt;/i&gt; (I love Latin binomials!). The pathogen lives in the louse gut, and is subsequently excreted onto the host, which then scratches the louse bite, thus infecting itself by rubbing the pathogen into the bite wound. What disease does &lt;i&gt;R. prowazekii&lt;/i&gt; cause?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;scrub typhus = 5&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;murine typhus = 6&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;epidemic typhus = 7&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;type O typhus = 8&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;E. What is special about the Echinophthiriidae?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;last word spelled correctly in the 2013 National Spelling Bee = 0&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;offered by native Siberians as a marriage offering= 1&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;only barklice that spin silken galleries = 6&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;only insects that infest aquatic hosts = 9&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;You are looking for a small camouflaged container, about 1 cubic inch in size. You will probably need a TOTT to retrieve the log. Also, there ain't much log, so write small. Finally PLEASE replace EXACTLY as found to preserve the difficulty of the hide.&lt;/div&gt;

Driving to this hide, I was reminded of days long since past.  I grew up in rural Missouri surrounded by woods and homes that had seen better days.  Past glories were long forgotten, and the brick buildings that once welled with pride slowly returned to nature.  One must be careful and have a reason for their visit in such places.  My excuse?  Photography.  [;)]

Lemme just go check it out. A new cache, eh? Hmmmm...it's a new spitoony insect puzzle out near Columbia. I like a good puzzle! 

Wait? What's this? More pings in rapid succession! Four more new caches, and more in the insect series, even! This is pretty cool, so I'm gonna have to work on this. The puzzles were good, and after some research and common sense I got them all solved. 

Fast forward to today. I dropped the kid off at school early because he had a morning function. After doing that, I then  made the trek to the caches. Pleasant drive to the area as always. I really like the countryside in this area, so being able to see it was rather nice. 

Anyway, I got to the cache area, jumped out of the geo-mobile and began my hunt. I went directly to where the coordinates stated the cache should be and found nothing. I looked everywhere it should have been and came up blank. It was only when I looked in a spot it should not have been that I found it. Opening the cache, I was greeted by a pristine log sheet! I happily scribbled my FTF signature (with the wrong date...apparently I am still living in yesterday) and put everything back as it was.

Thanks for placing this cache for everyone, myself included, to enjoy! TNLN/SL TFTC!

Yes, we know where our towels are...

   <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;The cache is NOT at the posted coordinates. I developed this cache series to share some facts about insects. Most of the answers can be easily googled. Some may take a little additional logic to get right. I hope fellow geocachers find this to be a fun and worthwhile series.&lt;/p&gt;
This cache is of a small size hidden along a roadway in mid-Missouri - no place special or particularly scenic. If nothing else, consider it an opportunity for a number boost!</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This cache asks questions about the taxonomic order Coleoptera, a.k.a, beetles!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final location is at N38 5A.BCA W92 1D.EAB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choose the answer that is correct to fill in the coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;A. The beetles are the most diverse single taxon on earth. Approximately what percentage of all species of life do beetle species represent?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;90% = 6&lt;br /&gt;
75% = 7&lt;br /&gt;
50% = 8&lt;br /&gt;
25% = 9&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;B. According to the American Institute of Biological Sciences, certain beetles save the United States cattle industry an estimated US$380 million annually through burying above-ground livestock feces. What is the common name of these remarkable insects?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;ground beetle = 3&lt;br /&gt;
bombardier beetle = 4&lt;br /&gt;
dung beetle = 5&lt;br /&gt;
ironclad beetle = 6&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;C. "What can be inferred about the Creator by examining His Creation?" "An inordinate fondness for beetles." This (probably apocryphal) reply to a question from a theologian was delivered by a 20th century scientist who later would abandon his home country and become a naturalized citizen of another due to political dissent. What were the two countries in question?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;USA and Brazil= 1&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Russia and USA= 2&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Iceland and UK= 3&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;UK and India= 4&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;D. What is the largest beetle?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Sabertooth Longhorn Beetle = 7&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Goliath Beetle = 8&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Titan Beetle = 9&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;All of the above can claim the title, depending on what criterion is used = 0&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;E. According to research published in the American Journal of Enology and Viticulture (2004), what beetle has been found to contaminate grapes and change the taste of wine?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;Calosoma scrutator&lt;/i&gt; = 0&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;Harmonia axyridis&lt;/i&gt; = 1&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hydroscapha natans&lt;/i&gt; = 2&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cupes capitatus&lt;/i&gt; = 3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;You're looking for a small black magnetic lump. Have fun!&lt;/div&gt;

Grrr!  Finding the cache was no problem at all; however, opening the sucker was incredibly difficult.  Various tools in the car did little to budge the lid.  Persistence seemed to pay off after some coaxing and steady pressure.  The log was signed, and the cache as closed lightly to save the next finder from the same agony.  [:P]</groundspeak:text>

Out caching after the "Battle of Binder Redux - CITO 2016" event on a gorgeous Saturday. The event went off without a hitch and the conditions couldn't have been better. The great weather continued into the afternoon, when it was at this point that I decided to go after these new caches.

I saw one pop up the night before, but I was too pooped to go after it, having already traveled to Marshall, Sedalia, Jeff City and back home. No matter...another cacher got the well-earned FTF. Early this morning, however, I noticed five more caches publish. Hmmm...better get to work on them. I got all but one solved, and that one was quickly rectified after I got a tip from the cache owner. Solving them was all I could do, though, because I had an event to attend.

After the event was over and we were heading back home, I noticed that the caches had remained unfound. What the heck, I thought...let's go for them! Best case scenario, I get a few FTF's and cache on a gorgeous day...worst case, I still get to cache on a gorgeous day! So, I loaded up the GPSr and scooted off down the road.

This cache was the third of the new caches I went after. As I neared ground zero, I had a good idea of what kind of hide it would be. I was right. Upon opening the cache, I discovered a nice, clean sheet yet again. After filling in the FTF spot, I put it back and set out for the next one.

Thanks for placing this cache for everyone, myself included, to enjoy! TNLN/SL TFTC!

   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;To find the coordinates to this cache, you will research answers to questions about a group of insects known as the Neuropterida. The Neuropterida comprise 3 orders: the Megaloptera, (dobsonflies, fishflies, and alderflies); the Neuroptera (lacewings, antlions, and owlflies), and the Raphidioptera (snakeflies). While the Neuroptera and Raphidioptera are also interesting, I decided to make all of the questions about the Megaloptera. The cache log also bears the name "Megaloptera", not "Neuropterida", fyi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final location is at N38 5A.BBC W92 1D.EFG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choose the answer that is correct to fill in the coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;A. The name of the order, Megaloptera, means?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;terminal spike = 5&lt;br /&gt;
sheath wing = 6&lt;br /&gt;
angel wing = 7&lt;br /&gt;
large wing = 8&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;B. Male dobsonflies bear an impressive pair of mandibles. What is their purpose?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;to facilitate mating = 6&lt;br /&gt;
to dig specialized egg-laying channels = 7&lt;br /&gt;
as gyroscopic control during flight= 8&lt;br /&gt;
to envenomize prey = 9&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;C. A hellgrammite is?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;a larval dobsonfly = 6&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;a supervillain in the DC comics universe = 7&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;a type of fish bait = 8&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;all of the above = 9&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;D. An easy one: (A-B)-2 =&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;0 = 0&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;1 = 1&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;2 = 2&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;3 = 3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;E. The Megaloptera undergo the most primitive form of what biological process?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;diurnal set-pointing = 2&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;complete metamorphosis = 3&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Cisuralian atropism = 4&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;vacillating pupation = 5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;F. In 2014, in Chengdu, Sichuan province (China) the largest known Megalopteran specimen was recently discovered. What was its wingspan?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;3.3 inches = 3&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;5.8 inches = 4&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;8.3 inches = 5&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;9.2 inches = 6&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Finally, G = (E+F)/2&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;You are looking for a camouflaged pill bottle. I boiled and washed out the bottle myself - so no worries on the pharmaceutical residues!&lt;/div&gt;

Driving up to the coordinates, I had a pretty good idea where the cache might be hiding after seeing a very suspicious location.  The car was parked, and my hunch was proven dead wrong.  Drat!  The GPS was dutifully followed to another couple of likely hiding places until something described in an earlier log was discovered.  A-ha!  The cache was . . . not there either.  It was when I was about to call this one "not found" that the container was spotted.  Nicely camouflaged!  I signed my name to the log as per geocaching custom.</groundspeak:text>

Out caching after the "Battle of Binder Redux - CITO 2016" event on a gorgeous Saturday. The event went off without a hitch and the conditions couldn't have been better. The great weather continued into the afternoon, when it was at this point that I decided to go after these new caches.

I saw one pop up the night before, but I was too pooped to go after it, having already traveled to Marshall, Sedalia, Jeff City and back home. No matter...another cacher got the well-earned FTF. Early this morning, however, I noticed five more caches publish. Hmmm...better get to work on them. I got all but one solved, and that one was quickly rectified after I got a tip from the cache owner. Solving them was all I could do, though, because I had an event to attend.

After the event was over and we were heading back home, I noticed that the caches had remained unfound. What the heck, I thought...let's go for them! Best case scenario, I get a few FTF's and cache on a gorgeous day...worst case, I still get to cache on a gorgeous day! So, I loaded up the GPSr and scooted off down the road.

This cache was the fourth of the new caches I went after. I went to the ground zero of this one and set about looking in exactly the wrong spot. Readjusting my bearings, I found the right spot and found a cache that blended in very nicely. Opening it up, another virgin log sheet presented itself. I sullied its reputation and put it back and set out for the next one.

Thanks for placing this cache for everyone, myself included, to enjoy! TNLN/SL TFTC!

Yes, we know where our towels are...

   <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;The cache is NOT at the posted coordinates. I developed this cache series to share some facts about insects. Most of the answers can be easily googled. Some may take a little additional logic to get right. I hope fellow geocachers find this to be a fun and worthwhile series.&lt;/p&gt;
This cache is of a small size hidden near a roadway in mid-Missouri - no place special or particularly scenic. If nothing else, consider it an opportunity for a number boost!</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This cache asks questions about the taxonomic class of the insects, a.k.a, Insecta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final location is at N38 5A.BCB W92 1D.DEF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choose the answer that is correct to fill in the coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;A. The number of species of insects on earth is what approximate percentage of all animal species?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;30% = 5&lt;br /&gt;
50% = 6&lt;br /&gt;
70% = 7&lt;br /&gt;
90% = 8&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;B. Which of the following statements is true?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;All insects are bugs. = 3&lt;br /&gt;
All bugs are insects. = 5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;C. All insects have three tagmata. What are they?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;front, middle, and hind legs = 2&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;head, thorax, abdomen = 3&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;egg, nymph, adult = 4&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;mandible, maxilla, labium = 5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;D. An easy one: The first letter for the taxonomic class that the insects belong to looks similar to this number&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;0 = 0&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;1 = 1&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;2 = 2&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;5 = 5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;E. This one is a little harder: Hexapoda is the subphylum that includes the insects. As the name implies, hexapods have 3 pair of legs. At one time, scientists considered all hexapods to be insects. Molecular and DNA evidence have since caused a revision to hexapod systematics. How many "groups" of hexapods, were once considered to be insects?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;2 = 4&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;3 = 6&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;4 = 8&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;5 = 0&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;F. The University of Missouri here in Columbia has an entomology club. It is named after a famous entomologist. How did this namesake scientist die?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Stung to death by bees = 6&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Killed by bandits in Ecuador = 7&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;After a years-long struggle with African Sleeping Sickness = 8&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Head trauma following a bicycle accident = 9&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;You are looking for a camouflaged spice bottle. It had black peppercorns in it and it still smells like pepper!&lt;/div&gt;

Ah, the fourth of July!  On this day many of us celebrate traditions that include fireworks, barbecue and . . . geocaching?  There was many a year that I forwent the usual festivities and instead struck out until the evening hour to find a geocache or two.  This day was no exception, and there was a series east of town to pursue.

Arriving at the coordinates, I parked the car and surveyed the area.  Quite a lot of brush appeared to be guarding the intended hiding place along with a plethora of birds!  I carefully searched but managed to irk one or two of the feathered creatures.  All but one flew away; perhaps they needed to keep an eye on me.  When the cache was discovered, I reasoned that the bird wouldn't tell.  [;)]  Some exploration was in order and dutifully carried out after the find.  There's quite a bit to see beyond the obvious border!  Be sure to check out some of the scenery when visiting.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Out caching after the "Battle of Binder Redux - CITO 2016" event on a gorgeous Saturday. The event went off without a hitch and the conditions couldn't have been better. The great weather continued into the afternoon, when it was at this point that I decided to go after these new caches.

I saw one pop up the night before, but I was too pooped to go after it, having already traveled to Marshall, Sedalia, Jeff City and back home. No matter...another cacher got the well-earned FTF. Early this morning, however, I noticed five more caches publish. Hmmm...better get to work on them. I got all but one solved, and that one was quickly rectified after I got a tip from the cache owner. Solving them was all I could do, though, because I had an event to attend.

After the event was over and we were heading back home, I noticed that the caches had remained unfound. What the heck, I thought...let's go for them! Best case scenario, I get a few FTF's and cache on a gorgeous day...worst case, I still get to cache on a gorgeous day! So, I loaded up the GPSr and scooted off down the road.

This cache was the fifth of the new caches I went after. For some reason, this one took me the longest to find. That cammo was really effective here! I eventually prevailed and found the cache and signed the log. I put it back and set out for the last one.

Thanks for placing this cache for everyone, myself included, to enjoy! TNLN/SL TFTC!

Yes, we know where our towels are...

Some may take a little additional logic to get right. I hope you fellow geocachers find this to be a fun and worthwhile series.</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This cache asks questions about the taxonomic order Diptera, a.k.a, the true flies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final location is at N38 5A.BCC W92 1D.EFB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choose the answer that is correct to fill in the coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;A. Diptera are so named because?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;they have only 2 eyes = 5&lt;br /&gt;
they have only 2 “flight” wings = 6&lt;br /&gt;
they have only 2 hind legs = 7&lt;br /&gt;
their flight has a characteristic “dip” = 8&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;B. The little scuttle fly, &lt;i&gt;Megaselia scataris&lt;/i&gt;, has been reared from which of the following?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;decaying vegetation. = 5&lt;br /&gt;
lung tissue of living people. = 6&lt;br /&gt;
shoe polish. = 7&lt;br /&gt;
all of the above. = 8&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;C. Mosquitoes (family Culicidae) are perhaps the most medically important insect on Earth. Which of the following diseases do mosquitoes not vector?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;dengue fever = 5&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;malaria = 6&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;chronic wasting disease = 7&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;pogosta disease = 8&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;D. What dipteran body part contains a region known as the alula?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;abdomen = 0&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;antennae = 1&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;wings = 2&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;mouth = 3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;E. Flies in the family Nemestrinidae are endoparasitoids (meaning their young develop inside the host and kill the host upon emergence) of what 2 other insect types?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;fleas and lice = 6&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;flies and ground beetles = 7&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;bats and moles = 8&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;grasshoppers and scarab beetles = 9&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;F. “They'll see and they'll know, and they'll say, 'Why, she wouldn't even harm a fly.” This line is from a famous movie by an even more famous director. Who?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Stanley Kubrick = 4&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Alfred Hitchcock = 5&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Gus Van Sant = 6&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Lars von Trier = 7&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

I needed to scout out some locations for some temp caches for a scout camp activity for next weekend so I decided to find some caches along the way.   This was find 1 for the day.

First I wasn't sure if I had one that I had solved, and had to check the web page to make sure the coords were the corrected coords I entered when I solved it.   Then my GPS put me about 30 feet east of the cache.   I did finally find it though and was able to sign the log and move on to the next cache of the day.  TFTC</groundspeak:text>

When arriving at locations such as these, I often wonder what will come in the ensuing years.  Potential knows no bounds, and, in this case, a geocache was envisioned.  Some stumbling around the coordinates was inevitable as there was a good deal of scatter on the GPS.  Eventually, the cache was found and dispatched as usual.  The time had come, alas, to disembark from this journey and pursue another.  Thank you for placing this series!  I'll get around to finding the rest in the near future.  [:)]</groundspeak:text>

Out caching after the "Battle of Binder Redux - CITO 2016" event on a gorgeous Saturday. The event went off without a hitch and the conditions couldn't have been better. The great weather continued into the afternoon, when it was at this point that I decided to go after these new caches.

I saw one pop up the night before, but I was too pooped to go after it, having already traveled to Marshall, Sedalia, Jeff City and back home. No matter...another cacher got the well-earned FTF. Early this morning, however, I noticed five more caches publish. Hmmm...better get to work on them. I got all but one solved, and that one was quickly rectified after I got a tip from the cache owner. Solving them was all I could do, though, because I had an event to attend.

After the event was over and we were heading back home, I noticed that the caches had remained unfound. What the heck, I thought...let's go for them! Best case scenario, I get a few FTF's and cache on a gorgeous day...worst case, I still get to cache on a gorgeous day! So, I loaded up the GPSr and scooted off down the road.

This cache was the sixth and last of the new caches I went after. After getting FTF on the other caches, I wasn't as hopeful about getting here first on this one, seeing as it's closest to Columbia. When I finally got to the appointed spot, I parked along a side road and walked over to the cache site. I found the container and opened it...blank! Not believing it, I signed the FTF spot, making it my fifth FTF of the day. Nice! I put everything back and moseyed my way to Columbia to get a celebratory soda and go to a spot to look for a few mushrooms.

This was a great series! Thanks for placing this cache for everyone, myself included, to enjoy! TNLN/SL TFTC!

   <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;The cache is NOT at the posted coordinates. This is part of the second wave of a cache series I’m using to quiz cachers about insects, and hopefully spread some knowledge. Most of the answers can be easily googled. Some may take a little additional logic to get right. I hope fellow geocachers find this to be a fun and worthwhile series.&lt;/p&gt;
Caches are in a final location that is no place special or particularly scenic. If nothing else, consider it an opportunity for a number boost!</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;To find the coordinates to this cache, you will research answers to questions about the insect order Thysanoptera – the thrips!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final location is at N38 5A.BCD W92 1E.AFE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choose the answer that is correct to fill in the coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;A. The Thysanoptera are known as the thrips. What is the singular form of the word thrips?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;trice = 4&lt;br /&gt;
thrip = 5&lt;br /&gt;
thrips = 6&lt;br /&gt;
thripe = 7&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;B. Tomato Spotted Wilt Virus (TSWV) is a plant disease vectored by thrips. What genus of virus is the causative agent in TSWV?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Tospovirus = 0&lt;br /&gt;
Teschovirus = 1&lt;br /&gt;
Tremovirus = 2&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;C. True or false - some species of thrips have evolved eusociality, similar to ants, bees, or termites.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;True = 2&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;False = 3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;D. All known genera of the thrips are capable of parthenogenesis, a reproductive strategy where unfertilized embryos can develop into adults. In some cases, the unfertilized embryos produce all male individuals; in others all female. What is the all-female form of parthenogenesis called?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Arrhenotoky = 0&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Autotoky = 2&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Epitoky = 4&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Thelytoky = 8&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;E. What is a Thunderbug?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;A British all-girl band circa 1999 = 0&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The mascot of the NHL's Tampa Bay Lightning = 1&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;One of many common names for thrips = 2&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;All of the above = 3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;F. Giving you this one.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;F = 1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;You are looking for a camouflaged tube.&lt;/div&gt;

Gravel dust clouds settled as my vehicle came to a halt.  Exiting the car, I looked at where the GPS pointed.  Hmmm . . . now this might be a bit challenging!  The hide itself was fairly straightforward; however, a nearby house required a small measure of stealth in order to retrieve the container.  All was completed as planned with nary a notice from the residence.  [:)]  With a sign and replace, I continued on my way.</groundspeak:text>

Sitting at home last night, I was doing nothing much more than watching television and goofing off on the internet. In other words, a typical evening in the A&amp;T house. PING New email! Lemme just go check it out. A new cache, eh? Hmmmm...it's a new spitoony insect puzzle out near Columbia. I like a good puzzle!

Wait? What's this? More pings in rapid succession! Four more new caches, and more in the insect series, even! This is pretty cool, so I'm gonna have to work on this. The puzzles were good, and after some research and common sense I got them all solved.

Fast forward to today. I dropped the kid off at school early because he had a morning function. After doing that, I then made the trek to the caches. Pleasant drive to the area as always. I really like the countryside in this area, so being able to see it was rather nice.

This was the final cache on the run. Upon arriving near ground zero, I had a decent idea where it was and I was right. Quickly having cache in hand, I discovered that no one had been to this cache! Signing the FTF spot, I put it back and made my way back home. 

Four out of five caches isn't too bad! Thanks for this fun series. [:)]

Thanks for placing this cache for everyone, myself included, to enjoy! TNLN/SL TFTC!

   <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;The cache is NOT at the posted coordinates. This is part of the second wave of a cache series I’m using to quiz cachers about insects, and hopefully spread some knowledge. Most of the answers can be easily googled. Some may take a little additional logic to get right. I hope fellow geocachers find this to be a fun and worthwhile series.&lt;/p&gt;
Caches are in a final location that is no place special or particularly scenic. If nothing else, consider it an opportunity for a number boost!</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;To find the coordinates to this cache, you will research answers to questions about the insect order Dermaptera – the earwigs!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final location is at N38 5A.ABC W92 1A.DEF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choose the answer that is correct to fill in the coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;A. Earwigs are known to practice rudimentary brood care, a type of behavior known as “subsociality”. The mother typically remains in the burrow with the eggs while they hatch and the nymphs develop. This brood care lasts only one or two molts, however, because ?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;the mother dies = 1&lt;br /&gt;
the mother leaves once the young are sexually mature = 2&lt;br /&gt;
the mother will eat the young after the second molt = 3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;B. Some earwigs are ectoparasites of what mammalian groups?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Elephants and weasels = 0&lt;br /&gt;
Bats and rats = 9&lt;br /&gt;
Rhymenocerus and hiphoppopotomus = 8&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;C. The common name “earwig” is derived from?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;(a) The fact that earwigs enters the ears of humans and lays its eggs = 4&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;(ß) The shape of their hind wings = 5&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;(?) The belief that earwigs enters the ears of humans and lays its eggs = 6&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;(d) ß and ? above = 7&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;D. The St. Helena giant earwig &lt;i&gt;Labidura herculeana&lt;/i&gt; is the largest earwig ever collected, reaching 78 mm (about 3 inches). It is now feared extinct. A commemorative stamp was issued in 1982 in honor of this insect. What continent is St. Helena Island nearest to?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;North America = 0&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;South America = 1&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Africa = 2&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Antarctica = 3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;E. Earwigs have a characteristic forceps-like set of “pincers” at the terminus of their abdomen, used in mating (not for defense by pinching; although a pinch may occur, it’s unlikely to cause pain). What is the proper term for these pincers?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;acutolobus = 0&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;cerci = 1&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;precogs = 2&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;raspberries = 3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;F. If I had a pet earwig, what would I name it?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Archie = 1&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Esther = 2&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Dwayne = 3&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;All of the above would be awesome names for a pet earwig! = 4&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Watching Spitoony's new series publish over the past few weeks, I was curious to see what the buzz was all about.  Several hours of internet research commenced and gave insight into the insects I thought I knew so well!  Coordinates derived revealed the true location of each hidden cache.  The hardest part was to come:  waiting for an opportunity to seek them.

On this day, the wait ended.  I gathered the usual geocaching gear and set out to find a handful of this series before an appointment later on.  Pavement receded as gravel took over the road.  Soon, a likely location came into sight and was verified with the GPS.  Finding the container, though, took considerably longer.  Well done!  With a signature in place, I took off to the next nearest hide in the list.</groundspeak:text>

Sitting at home last night, I was doing nothing much more than watching television and goofing off on the internet. In other words, a typical evening in the A&amp;T house. PING New email! Lemme just go check it out. A new cache, eh? Hmmmm...it's a new spitoony insect puzzle out near Columbia. I like a good puzzle!

Wait? What's this? More pings in rapid succession! Four more new caches, and more in the insect series, even! This is pretty cool, so I'm gonna have to work on this. The puzzles were good, and after some research and common sense I got them all solved.

Fast forward to today. I dropped the kid off at school early because he had a morning function. After doing that, I then made the trek to the caches. Pleasant drive to the area as always. I really like the countryside in this area, so being able to see it was rather nice.

Having gotten the FTF near Columbia, I started the trek back toward home with this cache. I got to the cache area, parked and started the search. Something in the area stuck out to me and that was where the prize turned out to be. Retrieving the log sheet presented yet another unsigned FTF space, which I quickly filled up. 

Nicely done on this cache! Favorite point for the container! Thanks for placing this cache for everyone, myself included, to enjoy! TNLN/SL TFTC!

Yes, we know where our towels are...

You may knot, but once you get to ground zero and branch out a bit, you'll see that someone has amassed a nice little collection of it nearby for themselves and just left it there!

You're looking for a simple, camouflaged container which holds only a log sheet. Obviously a writing utensil will be needed. Please place everything back as it was so that everyone can experience a similar caching adventure!&lt;br /&gt;

In most instances, you should be able to park within 10-15 feet of the cache. It can get some traffic from time to time, but you should usually be shielded from prying muggle traffic.&lt;br /&gt;

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">What a great find to break a long streak of no geocaching! It had been a while since *A. davidii* and I had found one, so before we headed over to a friends house for some Dungeons &amp; Dragons I suggested we try to find this one (since it WAS Get Outdoors Day, after all). As we pulled up to GZ I realized that we had made a fatal mistake: *we forgot a pen*. We decided to find it anyway. We got a good laugh from the hide itself, I'm sure it's startled a few. We left a flower in the hide temporarily to prove our presence. I plan to stop by after work one day this week to put our names on the physical log. TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

Morning traffic was cautiously navigated as I drove to this hide.  Why was I out so early?  After this listing posted last night, I resolved to give it a shot should it still be unfound when I awoke.  That promise was kept as I parked and exited the car.  Birds chirped overhead, and there were quite a few good places to look.  Thankfully, the cache was found before my shoes were dampened too much by the dew laden grass.  Yowza!  I'm glad I discovered this one during the day!  I signed the FTF spot and replaced the container.  Thank you for the early day find, A&amp;T!  [:D]</groundspeak:text>

   <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;The cache is NOT at the posted coordinates. I developed this cache series to share some facts about insects. Most of the answers can be easily googled. Some may take a little additional logic to get right. I hope fellow geocachers find this to be a fun and worthwhile series.&lt;/p&gt;
This cache is of a small size hidden along a roadway in mid-Missouri - no place special or particularly scenic. If nothing else, consider it an opportunity for a number boost!</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;To find the coordinates to this cache, you will research answers to questions about the insect order Dictyoptera – roaches, termites, and mantids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final location is at N38 5A.BAC W92 1D.EFE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choose the answer that is correct to fill in the coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;A. Mantids, termites and cockroaches were once considered three different orders of insects (some authorities still consider the mantids separate from the cockroaches+termites). Similarities in egg structure and egg cases across the three groups provide compelling evidence that they share a common ancestor, which is part of the reason for the combining of the three taxa into one order. What is the correct term for a mantid or cockroach egg case?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;stramineus = 6&lt;br /&gt;
vacuole = 7&lt;br /&gt;
gnomon = 8&lt;br /&gt;
ootheca = 9&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;B. What faith does Zorak the mantis claim to be?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Pentecostal = 0&lt;br /&gt;
Unitarian = 1&lt;br /&gt;
Episcopalian= 2&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;C. Female termite queens are the longest-lived of any insect. They can survive up to how many years?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;10 = 2&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;25 = 3&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;50 = 4&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;100 = 5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;D. The greatest natural enemy to termites are insects in another order that are often (incorrectly) believed to be closely related to termites. Name this group of insects.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;wasps = 5&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;ants = 6&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;mantids = 7&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;jumping bristletails = 8&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;E. Among the most remarked upon aspects of mantis behavior is cannibalism, particularly of a male while mating with a female. In nature, approximately what percent of male mantises meet this fate?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;10 = 6&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;25 = 8&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;50 = 9&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;90 = 7&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;F. The Madagascar hissing cockroach (&lt;i&gt;Gromphadorhina portentosa&lt;/i&gt;), has as many as three distinct hisses; disturbance, mating, and aggression. How is this hissing produced?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;air forced out from the spiracles = 0&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;air drawn in through the spiracles = 1&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;air forced out from the mouth = 2&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;air drawn in through the mouth = 3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;You are looking for a camouflaged matchstick container.&lt;/div&gt;

Following an early morning find, I decided to go for "just one more".  There was only so much time before needing to head home and prepare for the day.  Pavement slowly gave way to gravel as my cell phone's app lost the cache.  Thankfully, a GPS on hand came in to save the day!  [:)]  A short search unveiled the hidden container.  With a few quick scribbles, the find was claimed, and I was on my way home.</groundspeak:text>

Sitting at home last night, I was doing nothing much more than watching television and goofing off on the internet. In other words, a typical evening in the A&amp;T house. PING New email! Lemme just go check it out. A new cache, eh? Hmmmm...it's a new spitoony insect puzzle out near Columbia. I like a good puzzle! 

Wait? What's this? More pings in rapid succession! Four more new caches, and more in the insect series, even! This is pretty cool, so I'm gonna have to work on this. The puzzles were good, and after some research and common sense I got them all solved. 

Fast forward to today. I dropped the kid off at school early because he had a morning function. After doing that, I then  made the trek to the caches. Pleasant drive to the area as always. I really like the countryside in this area, so being able to see it was rather nice. 

After the DNF on the second cache I went after, I sought this one out. I saw the likely spot that fit the hint and that is where the cache was hiding. Upon opening it, I was pleased to find another blank log sheet. Right on! I signed FTF and put it back and took off to the next cache.

Thanks for placing this cache for everyone, myself included, to enjoy! TNLN/SL TFTC!

Yes, we know where our towels are...

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I told myself that I wasn't going to be that guy who ignores a nearby cache to come back when it was convenient for a challenge, but this one was tempting. I had just broken my caching streak, and was going to go home, but I had to get this one, because it was so close. There was a small geotrail through the weeds, though they were still tall and tick laden. The woods looked inviting, but I soon realized I'd walked into an intricate system of spider webs. I picked up a stick, but it was too late to do much good. Fortunately, I could still see the spiders on their webs, so I likely didn't have any on me. The cache was exactly what the title described. What a cool container.

Note to owner: This cache needs some TLC The bag is torn, and there is water inside of the cache itself along with icky remains of a gooey crayon. I didn't have anything to clean it out with. Thanks for the hide.</groundspeak:text>

   <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This cache will take you to a little cemetery forgotten by the passing of time. Rocky Fork Cemetery was started in 1821 and is located in Hinton, MO north of Columbia off Highway VV. It is a small, quiet resting place for many old residents of Boone County from early settlers, merchants, and businessmen to Confederate soldiers. Take time to wander the cemetery and read all the moss covered headstones. Truly a wonderful part of our local history.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This cache is a medium sized container with a log book and plenty of room for trinkets and trackables. BYOP. As you park in the church lot near the highway just take a stroll through the cemetery noting all the old dates and neat headstones. You are looking for a rather plain and lonely headstone in the cemetery.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Was in the area with Cribbage Witch - On our frequent route from St. Louis to St Joseph Area and back through KC to visit with the Folks in Maysville and the kids in KC. We decided to pick up a few caches to give ourselves time to stretch. Even though the trip was about double the length, Geocaching seemed to make it feel it went twice as fast. Thanks for putting these out to make our trip more enjoyable today.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I've been working of filling my calendar days for January and after a few failed attempts that I will have to get next year I've been able to fill the last few days with caches that have been newly published.    I thought I'd range away from the house a bit since I had time today.  This cache has been on my to do list for quite some time.  After arriving at the parking lot of the church I realized I didn't have my gel pen so I fished through the wife's van for one.   She had plenty to chose from so I picked one..   This seems like rambling but it's important later....   So I  made my way through the graveyard perusing the headstones.  Quite a lot of old ones.   Finally I made it to ground zero, and had the cache quickly in hand.  Opened it up, examined the contents, then pulled out the log applied the pen to paper, nothing.   Scribbled on the page, nothing....   ugh, so now I walked back to the van, log in hand, went through the 10 or so pens in the console and found ONE THAT WORKED this time....   the returned back to the cache replaced it all.   Yep. Always check the pen before walking to the cache..  TFTC</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Mud, No Gravel #1 (4:36 PM)

Ice and snow had begun melting and promised a bright spring for Mid-Missouri.  With sunny skies and temperatures in the 60's, who could resist getting out and enjoying the weather?  Roads rushed by as I drove highway 63 north and turned off on Hinton Road.  It wasn't until a departure to a driveway that the true extent of the ground saturation was realized.  Mud had seeped up and coated what was once gravel making parking an interesting task.  Would this be a continuing trend?

The graveyard was immensely interesting (if a bit slick)!  Several gravestones had tales to tell, and one sign indicated that another cemetery had been added to this one.  Photographs were taken to chronicle these echoes of the past.  Finding the geocaching during this tour was easy enough and illustrated a hidden gem.  Very cool!  The log was signed as per custom and all replaced as found.

Took nothing, left Tommy the Tombstone Traveler TB.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">On a quest to fill in all the remaining days on my calendar this year. Will I make it? So far the weather has held, and I've managed to find a cache on every open day I have left so far - 6 to go!

This cache was at an old cemetery.  The place itself was cool to explore.  Some of the names on the tombstones were very strange, but I suppose no more eccentric that what people are named nowadays.  The cache was found quickly, and there's a little surprise on the inside of the container lid that made me smile.  I must be getting old, the simple things do that to me.  Thanks so much for this cache!</groundspeak:text>

With darker evenings looming, I decided to get this one while there was still some daylight after work. It was a nice drive, and the walk to the geocache was beautifully lit by the sunset clouds.

In town to cheer on yoyoteacher while she does her first half marathon. We were at a point where we had to travel between parks when I got the email telling me of a new cache! I had never been here in Columbia when a new Columbia cache had published, save for one time at an event, so we decided to make a detour to go for it. The drive was pleasant and when we got to the area, there were no cars! I made my way to ground zero easily and had cache in hand quickly. I opened it up and was greeted by a virgin log, which I quickly deflowered with my signature. I put everything back and we zoomed of to go greet yoyoteacher at the finish line. Thanks for the cache and the fun!</groundspeak:text>

A very thin gray kitten followed me around the entire time I was looking and appeared to want to come home with me. There were other cats in the area, but for some reason one particular cat would not let this kitten get close to the food. Wish I had a home for it; the situation really tore at my heart strings.

As "I was going to need help" but I told them I would come back with my help (MSpry) and we would find it with out help.. and we did! MSpry found it very quickly. So I had to call them and let them know we found it, and check in on them. As I would not be a good son if did not check on my Mom and Dad once in while [:D] If I could give more than one favorite point i would. TFTC!!

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Back in March I sought this cache around 5:30-6:00am. I was confident that I'd solved the riddle, and would be able to find the cache with little difficulty. It ended up being a DNF. Though I didn't spend a whole lot of time looking for it, my hand had been on it, and I assumed that I was doing property damage rather than finding the cache, so I left it alone and went for the others on my list.

This time I brought along Yoyoteacher, who was given the response "Bingo!" when she suggested a particular type of hide. I told her that I'd already checked there, but she had the cache in her hand from the place I'd already checked, still slightly damaged by my fingernails on my first attempt. I was disgruntled with myself for being so close, but not coming up with the find, and elated that I could mark it off my DNF list. It fits in perfectly. Thank you for the hide!

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I had a very specific set of caches I was going to find, and this one was not on the list. I made a wrong turn, and realized that I would have to pass by this one to get back to Peabody, and I couldn't resist stopping. I spent roughly 5 minutes checking the idea that I had and moved on. It was before the store was open. This DNF should in no way deter other cachers from seeking this cache, and I will definitely be back to give it an honest effort.</groundspeak:text>

About two years ago he sold me an old chainsaw that had an engine that was completely junked so I could use it for parts. I used it and another chainsaw that I had laying around to to make a perfect Stihl chain saw. I still use it to this day.

Here's my response to the puzzle...

There once was a cacher named Goat
Who caches on foot and by boat
Some hides are so tough
But very soon enough
On his log sheets our names we have wrote!

I had a solution for the puzzle; however, it lead to what looked like private property in a subdivision.  Clarification was needed and acquired from Atomic Goat's Breath.  He provided a gentle nudge and righted an incorrect guess.  He even offered to drive out and meet me at the new solution.  The container was soon in hand after common sense intervened (where in the world was it earlier?!).  After signing the log, it was quite apparent that we were being surrounded by attention hungry cats.  We conversed a bit but kept it short in case these ravenous felines were starved for affection!

Thanks for a dope-slap worthy puzzle, Goat!</groundspeak:text>

Two new ones popped up north of town that I hadn't gotten to yet, so I set my sights on them. This was a nice little puzzle. I especially liked the cache container...very well done! While searching for this cache, I met the owner of the property and had a nice little chat with him.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">FTF at around 2013 this evening!  I had been thinking about this puzzle since it came out last night.  I was pretty sure I had solved the puzzle, but upon arriving at GZ, three additional possibilities popped up.  I ruled out two of them quickly, then poked around a bit while pondering the other two.  I looked, but didn't touch.  It was getting dark, the place was abandoned, and I didn't want to have any undue police attention drawn, so I decided to head home, and drop a line to the CO to put my suspicions to rest.  

With my thoughts confirmed, I headed back out to the area to make the grab.  Thank you for placing a fun puzzle and an excellent hide, Atomic Goats Breath!</groundspeak:text>

   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This is a cache in memory of my cousin Matthew Crosswhite.  He used to love coming to the Pinnacle Park and spend hours exploring.  He was known by his friends as just "Crosswhite".  He passed away on Feb 17 2009, suddenly, and is still missed by his family and friends.  In his honor 3 years later I am placing this cache so that Crosswhite will always be at the Pinnacles.  For the first to find there is a paracord keychain.
Thanks to Joann Cowan for permission to place the cache.
You are looking for a small round camo container.</groundspeak:long_description>

I was on my way out of town after a visit with my mom, and I decided I needed some caches to get the 7 souvenirs of August.  This was a convenient stop because of the nearby earthcache as well as this traditiona.  Plus this has always been a special area for me.  I spent a lot of good times here in the 1980s when I was going to high school and college.  Thanks for a good reason to stop.  Left a TB.</groundspeak:text>

County: Boone, Missouri
Delorme Grid: MO-030

Day 2 of my Midwest Journey to Geowoodstock XII from Des Moines, IA.  Today I started in Ottumwa, IA with some foggy weather and got into some rather stormy conditions as I made my way into Missouri.  Eventually I punched through a line of thunderstorms while moving west from Edina to Kirksville.  The rest of the day was quite delightful and the weather kept getting better and better before ending in Columbia, MO.  Most of my good friends going to GWS were well on their way to the event and I had hoped to see some on the journey, but I wound up not crossing paths with anyone though I evidently crossed paths with some of my Maryland friends near Macon or Moberly today.  Lots of fun caches to be had today!

I came to this small park after seeing the description for the nearby cache across the river.  I didn't realize that crossing the river was going to be a little rough so aborted that cache and went for this one instead.  Found it after a brief search in this somewhat nice hidden gem of a park.</groundspeak:text>

I always enjoy going to the Pinnacles, especially when I don't have to climb high and walk narrow ledges with precipitous drops.  I'd been in the general area of this cache before (for another cache), but this is an interesting area of the park. There were some neat rock formations along the way.  

Once my GPSr settled a little bit, it brought me to the cache location pretty quickly, but the real clue was a single, yellow, star I saw lying on the ground.  I looked at the closest likely hiding place, and there was the cache.  I signed the log, and headed back in the direction I had come, taking some photos on the way.  Thank you for placing thi cache, theridgeways!</groundspeak:text>

&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="green" size="5"&gt;Shelving Rock&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;Hidden within the rolling hills of Boone County and easily overlooked by passing motorists is the Pinnacles Youth Park. Even though it's not well-advertised, the wonderful geologic formations nestled within the boundaries of this park are worth a visit. Access to this treasure is found easily off U.S. 63, about 12 miles north of Columbia.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Shelving Rock lies just downstream from the namesake Pinnacles. Exploring this feature, one begins to wonder if it has been used in the past for shelter by animals or man. On special days after it has rained, numerous faucets of water emanate from the interior wall, as if Mother Nature herself chose to equip this natural domicile with plumbing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Streams have a tendency to erode and undercut on the outside of bends because of centrifugal force. As the water carries silt, rocks and other materials, it acts as an abrasive agent against the rock. This action, combined with solution weathering (acids and chemicals which react with minerals on the bank, especially limestone), creates erosional features such as Shelving Rock. In this case, it was formed by the constant erosional action of the waters of Silver Fork, the same stream which helped to create the Pinnacles.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Much like the Pinnacles, Shelving Rock is composed of the Burlington Limestone, which is approximately 300 million years old. In many areas, this is an exceptionally pure limestone and is quarried at a number of points in eastern and central Missouri and as far southwest as Springfield, Missouri. This particular kind is famous for possessing many kinds of marine fossils, particularly crinoids. This limestone is the source material for the columns of the University of Missouri-Columbia's Red Campus and Boone County's Old Courthouse.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;SOURCE: &lt;u&gt;Geologic Wonders and Curiosities&lt;/u&gt; by Thomas R. Beveridge,&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;The Pinnacles Youth Park is administered by a board of directors and is patrolled by the Boone County Sheriff's Department. The park is open from 8 a.m. until dark. The gates close an hour before dark.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;font color="red"&gt;Please do not put yourself and geocaching in danger by violating the hours that have been established for this park.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="green" size="3"&gt;The walk to this EarthCache is a nice and easy one, with a nice path all the way to the feature. One could probably push a stroller to this one without much issue. On the way, you'll pass other formations as well, so feel free to inspect those as well.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;font size="3"&gt;1. Approximately how high is the roof of Shelving Rock at its opening? At the back wall of the structure?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
2. The ceiling structure changes as you go back in. How does the ceiling's surface at the opening differ from the back?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
3. How wide would you estimate Shelving Rock to be?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
4. What is the elevation at the posted coordinates?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
5. While completely optional and not required, it would be nice to post a photo of yourself with Shelving Rock behind you.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

I wanted to do more of the Earthcaches on this trip, but The Bride and Buckette made sure I didn't have enough time to enjoy that goal...he, he.  But I did stop here and wow...what an amazing place to visit.  When we pulled into the parking lot there had to be about 20 cars pulling in at the same time.  I'm thinking picnic, nope I was wrong.  

It ended up being a baptism and at the very same place of the shelving rock.  They church group was singing and it was very cool to see.  Just love this area back here.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Went there today, started walking down the trail and a snake shot across the trail right under my feet. Of course this made me jerk my head to see what it was. Jerking my head quickly made my vertigo kick into high gear. I lost my balance and fell, nothing injured except my ego. Decided that since I was already 1/2 the way I'd try to finish the cache. Arrived at GZ and something (a darn pigeon) caused ne to look up quickly. Guess what? Instant vertigo again. Did my best at getting the info I needed and started back, my cane slipped on something and down I went for a second time. Again nothing injured. The area was really nice and except for the vertigo I had a good time. Email with answers sent.</groundspeak:text>

County: Boone, Missouri
Delorme Grid: MO-030

Day 2 of my Midwest Journey to Geowoodstock XII from Des Moines, IA.  Today I started in Ottumwa, IA with some foggy weather and got into some rather stormy conditions as I made my way into Missouri.  Eventually I punched through a line of thunderstorms while moving west from Edina to Kirksville.  The rest of the day was quite delightful and the weather kept getting better and better before ending in Columbia, MO.  Most of my good friends going to GWS were well on their way to the event and I had hoped to see some on the journey, but I wound up not crossing paths with anyone though I evidently crossed paths with some of my Maryland friends near Macon or Moberly today.  Lots of fun caches to be had today!

Nice surprising spot to find in the middle of Missouri.  I had walked down the path to see what was here and noted how nice it was, but failed ot notice this EarthCache was here at first.  Only after finding a nearby traditional did I see I walked past the coordinates and then came right back to perform the tasks for the EC.

I enjoyed the formation and the geology of the area!  TFTC.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">lagrac and I were tired of the cold winter weather so we made our way south for a bit less snow caching. Thankfully the snow here has disappeared.  We had a very nice walk to this in some awesome weather.  Arriving at GZ we took a lot of time admiring the area then got to work on the answers which have been sent.  This was a great area and I appreciate having an EarthCache here to bring us here!!!  Picture is posted with lagrac's log and the answers have been sent.  TFTEC  [:o)]</groundspeak:text>

Great area you've got here.
We gathered the required information and then posed for a quick picture.
Thanks so much for developing this EC.
It was very informational and a lot of fun.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Out caching with Justin and Maxine and our sons today.   After helping them with a multi down in Rocky Fork Conservation area we decided to go after some caches in this park.   The boys enjoyed playing under the shelf and in the rest of the park.   Logan spotted a letterbox right after we found the answer to this earthcache.  Since I don't have a stamp I showed the group what the differences between geocaching and letterboxing are and replace the letter box back in it's hiding place.   Answers have been sent to the CO.</groundspeak:text>

&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="green" size="5"&gt;The Pinnacles&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;Hidden within the rolling hills of Boone County lie the Pinnacles. These Sirens beckon the visitor to take heed of the wonderful geologic formations nestled within the boundaries of the Pinnacles Youth Park. Access to this treasure is found easily off U.S. 63, about 12 miles north of Columbia.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This slim ridge lies between two streams, Silver Fork and Kelley Branch. It was formed when Silver Fork doubled back on itself and met the parallel Kelley Branch. These streams crowded each other so closely that what remains is a precariously thin, approximately 1,000-foot ridge as an erosional remnant. One of the probable influences in this action are parallel vertical rock fracture planes that caused the streams to take the paths that they did.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
All in all, the ridge itself doesn't have much time left, geologically-speaking, as it's only several feet wide at some points and has already been perforated a few times, leaving windows through the formation. At some point, probably in a few thousand years, either one of the streams will breach the ridge or it will collapse.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Pinnacles are composed of the Burlington Limestone, which is approximately 300 million years old. In many areas, this is an exceptionally pure limestone and is quarried at a number of points in eastern and central Missouri and as far southwest as Springfield, Missouri. This particular kind is famous for possessing many kinds of marine fossils, particularly crinoids. This limestone is the source material for the columns of the University of Missouri-Columbia's Red Campus and Boone County's Old Courthouse.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

Second Edition, revised by Jerry D. Vineyard, 392 p., 163 figs., app., 1991.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;table border="3" width="100%" bgcolor="#000000"&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;The Pinnacles Youth Park is administered by a board of directors and is patrolled by the Boone County Sheriff's Department. The park is open from 8 a.m. until dark. The gates close an hour before dark.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;font color="red"&gt;Please do not put yourself and geocaching in danger by violating the hours that have been established for this park..&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;table border="3" width="100%" bgcolor="#000000"&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;font color="red" size="4"&gt;Do &lt;u&gt;NOT&lt;/u&gt; attempt this EarthCache if it's been snowing or if it's icy. The terrain on top of the ridge can become quite treacherous in such conditions and people have been seriously injured from falling. I cannot stress this enough; take your time as you make your way up and be safe! We want to see you again on the caching trail.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;font size="3"&gt;Depending on the river conditions you might be able to cross the stream on stepping stones or using rubber boots...all else failing, you just might get your feet wet.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;font color="green" size="3"&gt;This particular EarthCache will require you to do some work with your GPSr as you explore this treasure. First, at the posted coordinates above, take an elevation reading and record it for later. Make your way to the top of the ridge, and stop at these coordinates:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color="blue"&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;N 39º 08.025 W 092º 19.352&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="green"&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;. Take an elevation reading here and record the information.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;font color="green"&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;Now carefully make your way back down the path from which you came and stop at these coordinates:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color="blue"&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;N 39º 08.022 W 092º 19.378&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="green"&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;. These coordinates should put you in front of what I like to call the Picture Rock because it's a great spot for a quick snapshot. It's completely optional, but if you'd like to do just that, feel free to do so and post it here with your log.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="blue"&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="green"&gt;&lt;font color="blue"&gt;&lt;font color="green"&gt;&lt;font color="green"&gt;&lt;font color="blue"&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v329/Mizzou02RS/04267a5e.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;font color="green"&gt;&lt;font color="blue"&gt;&lt;font color="green"&gt;&lt;font color="green"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;font color="red" size="4"&gt;Any logs that do not follow these requirements will be deleted.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;font size="3"&gt;1. What is one possible influence that caused the two streams to flow so close together?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
2. Using your two elevation readings you took, subtract the first from the second. What is the approximate height of the Pinnacles?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
3. Approximately how wide is the rock window at the second waypoint?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
4. How wide and long is the top of the Picture Rock?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
5. While completely optional and not required, it would be nice to post a photo of yourself on top of the Pinnacles or with Picture Rock behind you.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;center&gt;

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Camping with Benbot99 and his cub scout pack this weekend.  This earthcache was the last cache in this park I had not logged and with the 15th anniversary souvenir being offered for the weekend I decided if I had the chance I'd go for it.  Benbot99 wanted to climb the pinnacles and my opportunity opened.  He balked a bit as I took readings at stage one and recorded numbers on my phone but after we got to the top he was fine with my distraction.   Finally after the second reading was taken, we went to the window and I snapped a picture of him down inside it.   Added some pictures of some very pretty flowers that were on the trail.  Perfect day weather wise and a great time had by both Ben and I.   TFTC</groundspeak:text>

Today was a lot different. 80 degrees, the park full of people and a little wading through the creek would not stop me. I made my way to the top and then had Mother Nature pose for lots of pictures. What a great adventure this was. Gave me a little adrenaline rush in fact. This is what Geocaching is all about. Thanks for the fine earth cache Arthur &amp; Trillian! Well done!

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">The final day of this crazy 31 Days of Geocaching had to be something special. One of my favorite types, from the moment I saw my first one, has been Earthcaches. So where better to go than the Pinnacles! After work, the day was cooling off, and I had the park to myself. A quick scramble across the (nearly bone dry) creek and up, and I had one of the best views in Boone County. I had to remind myself to get the information for the cache, since I was rather out of breath and fascinated by the trees, rocks, and view. The rocks were smooth under my hands from their prominent exposure. Trees cling to patches of soil, and look amazing in profile against the sky.

I may have not done poetry for all the days of this challenge, but this spot could really inspire some.</groundspeak:text>

Even a couple of locals that said they hike the area often said it would be nuts to try to go the top with the snow and ice.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">E-mail sent.  I started to tackle this Earthcache the same day I did Shelving Rock, but I had one of my grandsons and my niece along, and was afraid I was going to have to cross the narrow portion of the trail to get to the furthest point.  I found out today that I didn't need to do that, so I could have completed this back in July of 2011.  Oh, well.  I was able to get the smiley today, at least.  

I always enjoy hiking up the Pinnacles for the view and the exhilaration of the journey.  I had psyched myself up to make the crossing of the narrow ledge, just a bit beyond Waypoint two.  I was glad I didn't have to continue on, and was able to get all the answers I needed from there on back.  I will be back again to this one with the grandkids, once I figure out how to harness them to make sure they don't take any shortcuts to the bottom.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">GREAT EARTHCACHE!!!!!!! I was here on the 10th and the 11th. I started off climbing up near GZ for the traditional cache located here. I couldn't find it. I didn't have the GPS, since I got seperated from the group when I got stuck and said I'd go back down and meet them from another route, and then couldn't make myself take the last section down to the bottom. I finally found another way up. I read the earthcache page and got some of the info on the 10th, then talk pops into making and early cache run on the 11th to look for the traditional and finish getting the info on this one. I wrote it all down on my hand, but after I bit it on some wet rocks, I rubbed off half the info, along with a bunch of skin. At least I didn't fall from the top. This is such a cool place, my sister has lived in Columbia for 10+ years and I have visited many times and never knew about this place. I will definitely be back.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Another awesome stop on the way back home east. We are from the KCMO area and we were visiting some friends for the weekend in Saint Louis. The plan was to get to Saint Louis the fast way but to go home the long way. We plotted a route north of the interstate to grab us some Missouri counties for our challenge and also knocked some pages of the MO DeLorme challenge also. We completely succeeded and we had a really nice drive back home. It took us about 10 hours tho but it was worth it.

Earthcaches rock my world literally. This one was not the exception and on the contrary it was like a huge mega earthquake when we discovered the Pinnacles standing in front of us. There were a group of youngster hanging out in the park and a couple rock climbing the Pinnacles. We were mesmerized by the size and height of them. It was awesome just watching them from the ground. Then we started our journey up. I was a bit worried about MothraMandy because she was wearing only flip flops and she has a bit of fear of heights but she did awesome. The climb was not too hard and when we reached the top of the Pinnacles I feel like I can touch the clouds. MothraMandy had a blast too and she faced her fear of heights like a champ. We were here about couple hours before sunset and the sun just hit the limestone rocks perfectly for good pictures. My phone died so MothraMandy had most of the shots. Great earthcache and awesome location. We were super delighted and happy that geocaching showed us such great hidden treasure. MothraMandy attende MU in Columbia and never heard about this park. It is definitively a must see area if you are crossing over the area. Super awesome earthcache. The trees growing on the limestone are amazing too. Their roots resemble natural bonsai roots growing on rocks.</groundspeak:text>

I decided to try and ignore my acrophobia for this one. Wifey was too pooped to even get out of the truck after a full day geocaching. It wasn't too bad. Very interesting area and a great EarthCache. Extra nice to have Shelving Rock EC so close. TFTEC.</groundspeak:text>

Leaving the Pinnacles area to see a flock of Hot Air balloons. Watching a "bust" outside Taco Bell when I was eating my supper. Driving for 5 hours under the light of the "super moon." Oh, yeah, and finding this cool earthcache! :) Yo would tell you I was tired and cranky and whiney as we looked for this, and she'd be right. But I was that way before going for this cache, it had nothing to do with it. :) But this is really my fave kind of cache, scrambling around on rocks. I would be happy if all my cache finds included rock scrambles. Well, if they also included dry shoes. Ha! Thank you so very much for placing this one here!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Stopped by here on the way home from MOGA '12 in Iowa.  The rain was coming down pretty good however we didn't want to pass up an opportunity to find an Earthcache.  This is a very nice park and we enjoyed it very much.  We will email you with our answers.  We did manage to snap this picture without getting our phone too wet.  You can see the raindrops in the water.  Thank you Arthur &amp; Trillian for the cache.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">A great Friday to get out to the Pinnacles. We crossed the bridge and hiked the ridge from the north trying to keep our feet dry. With this route we did things a little backwards, but had a great time. We are out from AZ visiting our son in Columbia, and wanted to revisit this place. Thanks for a great EC.</groundspeak:text>

Was in the area with Cribbage Witch - On our frequent route from St. Louis to St Joseph Area and back through KC to visit with the Folks in Maysville and the kids in KC.  We decided to pick up a few caches to give ourselves time to stretch.    Even though the trip was about double the length, Geocaching seemed to make it feel it went twice as fast.    Thanks for putting these out to make our trip more enjoyable today.</groundspeak:text>

Weather prediction was sunny and 50's for the day after Christmas.  I had not been out for a major cache run since July so I got permission from the muggle wife and our adventure was set.  We left before dawn and the plan was to return after sunset.  This was cache 3 for the day.  
  I've been wanting to do this cache since it first published.   This is the type of hide I enjoy.  When we arrived at the parking spot I spotted what I thought was the spot but the GPSr took me to an even bigger tree that must have been beautiful before when it was in it's glory.  We retreived the cache and signed our team name TAD and were off to another cache. TFTC</groundspeak:text>

Day 2 of my Midwest Journey to Geowoodstock XII from Des Moines, IA.  Today I started in Ottumwa, IA with some foggy weather and got into some rather stormy conditions as I made my way into Missouri.  Eventually I punched through a line of thunderstorms while moving west from Edina to Kirksville.  The rest of the day was quite delightful and the weather kept getting better and better before ending in Columbia, MO.  Most of my good friends going to GWS were well on their way to the event and I had hoped to see some on the journey, but I wound up not crossing paths with anyone though I evidently crossed paths with some of my Maryland friends near Macon or Moberly today.  Lots of fun caches to be had today!

Nice bold hide!  Rarely see one hidden so "open" as this.  I enjoyed it and think it deserves a FP.</groundspeak:text>

Heading north from Columbia, I drove along highway 63 singing along to the radio.  It was yet another day that required fulfillment for the geocaching challenge, and all prior attempts took me either west or south.  A new cache in Moberly prompted the change in compass direction.  Parking was easily found nearby; however, ice on the pavement brought forth caution.  Approaching the coordinates, a sizable tree stump was admired.  This must have been one large tree in its day!  The cache was spotted soon thereafter and quickly retrieved.  A new signature was added to the log book, and the container was replaced as found with a little bit of additional geocover.  Thanks for an interesting hide!

Took nothing, left nothing.</groundspeak:text>

When I found the cache, however, ice did become an issue!! It was very firmly iced into its spot!

I made several trips to my car, trying various objects to scrape off or dislodge ice and cache. In the end, it was my trusty walking stick that levered it out! You know the quote, "Give me a lever and a place to stand and I shall move the world." Which is what I did. 

I took the cache to a nearby table to sign. I took the candy, not a good cache item! And left one of the tools that is useful, just not for ice removal.

Thanks for the {*FTF*} and the really cool stump! When things thaw out, this might need better cover. If I were a kid, that location would be a playground!

The main goal of the day was to simply enjoy myself doing what I really love doing...caching! Along the way, though, any cacher worth their salt would take in the awesome sights, which is exactly what I did! I gotta say, this area of the state is quite beautiful! I was not alone, having the spirits of cachers past tagging along, which added to the fun. Okay, I was kidding about the last part, LOL.

This cache was one of the caches I had the privilege of finding. Thanks for placing this cache for everyone, myself included, to enjoy! TNLN/SL TFTC!

   <groundspeak:short_description html="True">This is a nice small park with a nice lake and picnic tables and a neat bridge that crosses over the lake. Be sure to read the information on left as you get onto the bridge from the parking lot. The cache is should be easy to get to its on flat ground.</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This cache is part of the Peanuts Gang series in Rothwell Park and Lion's Beuth park. I have chosen the area because there is many areas you can park and still get to more than one cache by walking and then can get back into your vehicle and park again to get the next set of caches. You can also if you want walk or bike the nice trails in the area to get to most of the caches. There are also many things to do in the park, plan to bring the family and stay for more enjoyment after your cache adventure that will take you to many areas of the park including around the lake which will give you good views. If you do bring your kids please watch them when around vehicle used areas and the lake caches are not next to the water and you will have several feet if they get away from you. Most to all the cache should not take long to find depending on your expertise.V1p3rx and I have worked to make the series fun and not finding the same old thing over and over. You will find a couple different styles of hides and also one that is maybe not be the expected way to retrieve the cache from the rest of the series. Stealth may be required due to being close to trails, or areas people may visit. We have attempted to give you geocover in all areas but it is a park. Please make sure the cache is hidden well when you place it back into its hiding spot. There is a archery range in the area so use caution even though caches are not placed in the area of the archery. Hope you enjoy the area and caches available in the park and this series.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charles (Sparky) Monroe Schulz was born on November 22nd, 1922 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, but grow up in St. Paul Minnesota at the age of 77 he passed away on February 12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 2000 in Santa Rosa, California. Schulz first comic strip was called &lt;em&gt;Li’l Folks and ran from June 1947-January 1950 in the&lt;/em&gt; St. Paul Pioneer Press. In Li’l Folks was the first time Schulz used the name Charlie Brown and he created a dog that also looked much like Snoopy. In May of 1948 Schulz sold the first of his one panel drawing to The Saturday Evening Post. After his Li’l Folks comic strip was dropped in the 1950’s, Schulz went to United Feature Syndicated with the one panel Li’I Folks. Interested in his one panel comic, However Schulz had developed a normal four panel strip and at that time and United Feature Syndicated became interested and decided to publish a four panel comic. Peanuts made its debut on October 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt;, 1950, in seven different newspapers. The popular weekly Sunday page made its first appearance on January 6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 1952. When the Peanuts comic strip was on top, it was published every day in 2,600 papers in 75 countries, 21 languages. In almost 50 years the Peanuts comic strip was produced Schulz drew nearly 18,000 strips. Between the comic strips, merchandise, product endorsement produced revenues of more than 1 billion per year. Schulz’s estimated earrings was 30-40 million annually. The Peanuts comic strip only once why Schulz was alive have reshowings when Schulz went on vacation for five-weeks to celebrate his 75&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; birthday. Schulz never had assistants creating the strip and refused to hire an inker or letterer. On December 14&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; 1999 Schulz announced his retirement due to having several small strokes and a blocked aorta. It was later discovered he had colon cancer that had metastasized. Once Schulz started chemotherapy he was unable to see clearly. Schulz on February 12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 2000 died in his sleep around 9:45 P.M. from colon cancer. The last original Peanuts comic strip was produced the next day on Sunday, February 13&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;. Charles Monroe Schulz is buried in Pleasant Hill Cemetery in Sebastopol, California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:1.6;"&gt;Marcie-Marcie's first appearance was on July 20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:1.6;"&gt;, 1971, however she was not named until October 11&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:1.6;"&gt;, 1971. She was last seen on January 2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:1.6;"&gt;, 2000 comic strip. Marcie made her first appearance on television in There's No Time For Love, Charlie Brown in 1973. In the TV series Your in the Super Bowl, Charlie Brown Marcie's given name was Johnson, however she was never given a last name in the comic strip, Schulz never gave her an official last name.  Marcie and Peppermint Patty were good friends. Marcie called Peppermint Patty "Sir", why Peppermint Patty referred to Marcie as "dorky" or when talking to others as "My wired friend from camp".   Marcie is a look alike character. In the 1968 Schulz created a character named Clara that had the same appearance as Marcie did when she was created in 1971.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:1.6;"&gt;When Geocaching please respect and follow the rules of the park.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Park is open to the public daily from 5:00 a.m.-11:00 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not damage any of the parks property, tress, or other wildlife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope you enjoy the park and its amenities. &lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I was sitting at home doing not much of anything, chatting with dphickey about this and that, when he mentioned that he was thinking about a caching run up to Moberly. He wanted to avenge some DNF's, find some new caches and go for a FTF! Well, we teamed up to go accomplish these very goals. I needed a couple he had and he needed a couple I had, so with mutual goals, we set off!

This was the final cache we stopped at for the day, and since dphickey was the FTF, this one was all me. He wandered off as I began to search the logical spot. After a little looking, I found that container! Neat placement! I signed the log and put everything back as it was.

Thanks for the fun cache! TNLN/SL TFTC!

FTF LOG:  Rainy Sunday cache run.   Sitting at home with a house full of kids I was beginning to get grumpy.  I logged on to Geocaching.com and browsed around and noticed that there was a cache in Moberly that had not been found yet.   FTF run?   Why not.  Asked the wife if she wanted to go for a drive and after completing a few errands we were off.   She relaxed with a book in the car on the way to Moberly and I planned on a few caches after getting a FTF.   Once we arrived at the park we admred the pretty scenery and then I put the rain coat on and made my way across the bridge.  I noticed a pretty little waterfall, took some pictures and then made my way to GZ.   After arriving at GZ I spotted the cache right off, but the approach was not clear.   How to reach the cache without getting completely soaked?  Finally I just dived in and pushed through to find a blank log... awesome FTF.   Signed the log, replaced the cache and made my way back to the car.  TFTC</groundspeak:text>

   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is part of the Peanuts Gang series in Rothwell Park and Lion's Beuth park. I have chosen the area because there is many areas you can park and still get to more than one cache by walking and then can get back into your vehicle and park again to get the next set of caches. You can also if you want walk or bike the nice trails in the area to get to most of the caches. There are also many things to do in the park, plan to bring the family and stay for more enjoyment after your cache adventure that will take you to many areas of the park including around the lake which will give you good views. If you do bring your kids please watch them when around vehicle used areas and the lake caches are not next to the water and you will have several feet if they get away from you. Most to all the cache should not take long to find depending on your expertise.V1p3rx and I have worked to make the series fun and not finding the same old thing over and over. You will find a couple different styles of hides and also one that is maybe not be the expected way to retrieve the cache from the rest of the series. Stealth may be required due to being close to trails, or areas people may visit. We have attempted to give you geocover in all areas but it is a park. Please make sure the cache is hidden well when you place it back into its hiding spot. There is a archery range in the area so use caution even though caches are not placed in the area of the archery. Hope you enjoy the area and caches available in the park and this series.
&lt;p&gt;Charles (Sparky) Monroe Schulz was born on November 22nd, 1922 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, but grow up in St. Paul Minnesota at the age of 77 he passed away on February 12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 2000 in Santa Rosa, California. Schulz first comic strip was called &lt;em&gt;Li’l Folks and ran from June 1947-January 1950 in the&lt;/em&gt; St. Paul Pioneer Press. In Li’l Folks was the first time Schulz used the name Charlie Brown and he created a dog that also looked much like Snoopy. In May of 1948 Schulz sold the first of his one panel drawing to The Saturday Evening Post. After his Li’l Folks comic strip was dropped in the 1950’s, Schulz went to United Feature Syndicated with the one panel Li’I Folks. Interested in his one panel comic, However Schulz had developed a normal four panel strip and at that time and United Feature Syndicated became interested and decided to publish a four panel comic. Peanuts made its debut on October 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt;, 1950, in seven different newspapers. The popular weekly Sunday page made its first appearance on January 6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 1952. When the Peanuts comic strip was on top, it was published every day in 2,600 papers in 75 countries, 21 languages. In almost 50 years the Peanuts comic strip was produced Schulz drew nearly 18,000 strips. Between the comic strips, merchandise, product endorsement produced revenues of more than 1 billion per year. Schulz’s estimated earrings was 30-40 million annually. The Peanuts comic strip only once why Schulz was alive have reshowings when Schulz went on vacation for five-weeks to celebrate his 75&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; birthday. Schulz never had assistants creating the strip and refused to hire an inker or letterer. On December 14&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; 1999 Schulz announced his retirement due to having several small strokes and a blocked aorta. It was later discovered he had colon cancer that had metastasized. Once Schulz started chemotherapy he was unable to see clearly. Schulz on February 12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 2000 died in his sleep around 9:45 P.M. from colon cancer. The last original Peanuts comic strip was produced the next day on Sunday, February 13&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;. Charles Monroe Schulz is buried in Pleasant Hill Cemetery in Sebastopol, California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woodstock-The first appearance for Woodstock was March 4&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 1966, Woodstock did not get a name until June 22&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt;, 1970. The last appearance for Woodstock was January 16&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 2000 in comic strip. Woodstock and Snoopy became friends in the daily strip when on April 4&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 1967 when Snoopy was on top of his dog house and a bird later called Woodstock landed on Snoop’s nose and over the next two days began to talk to Snoopy about not liking having to fly South for the winter and how he was not blessed with good flying skills. When Woodstock talks its in chicken scratch with letters and punctuation to show usually sleep or emotions. Snoopy was the only one to really understand. Woodstock became Snoop’s sidekick. The first Role Woodstock had was a Mechanic for Snoop’s WWI Flying ace. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Geocaching please respect and follow the rules of the park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Park is open to the public daily from 5:00 a.m.-11:00 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not damage any of the parks property, tress, or other wildlife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope you enjoy the park and its amenities.  &lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Rainy Sunday cache run.   Sitting at home with a house full of kids I was beginning to get grumpy.  I logged on to Geocaching.com and browsed around and noticed that there was a cache in Moberly that had not been found yet.   FTF run?   Why not.  Asked the wife if she wanted to go for a drive and after completing a few errands we were off.  After getting FTF on another cache in this series I decided to run over to this park and grab some of the series I didn't get on a previous trip as well as rectify a few DNFs.   I picked this one as it was closest.   The wife again stayed in the car as I made my search.   Cache was spotted quickly and I had to push my way into the spot to reach it.   Signed the log and returned to the car only to have my wife tell me I smelled like cat pee.   One thing about the tree that was at GZ, they tend to smell....  TFTC</groundspeak:text>

Well, now this monument was quite familiar.  Parking there, I grabbed my GPS and the one working flashlight.  Remember kids:  spares are always a good idea!  A nearby trail ended abruptly next to a gate leaving me the only option of traversing grass.  Given the brush encountered earlier in the day, this was most welcome!  The hiding place for the cache was evident but took some time to negotiate for the container.  It was found in good shape, and the log was signed.</groundspeak:text>

I was out and about caching along the I-44 corridor, having just bagged a FTF in St. James, when what do I hear? Dings of emails! New, it's not safe to check them while driving, so at the first convenient spot, I looked to see what was up. Two new caches in Moberly! Well, I figured I was way too far away to even have a possibility to get them, so I reverently passed on them.

Fast forward to today. I was making my rounds on the internet when I checked the geocaching website and lo and behold, the caches were not found yet! What the heck, I figured...let's go for them!

So, I packed up my stuff and took off. In no time, I was there. I got to ground zero just fine and found the container. Finding it was no issue...retrieving it was. I am mildly allergic to the host spot. No matter, though...I got it!

Thanks for the fun cache! TNLN/SL TFTC!

   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This cache is part of the Peanuts Gang series in Rothwell Park and Lion's Beuth park. I have chosen the area because there is many areas you can park and still get to more than one cache by walking and then can get back into your vehicle and park again to get the next set of caches. You can also if you want walk or bike the nice trails in the area to get to most of the caches. There are also many things to do in the park, plan to bring the family and stay for more enjoyment after your cache adventure that will take you to many areas of the park including around the lake which will give you good views. If you do bring your kids please watch them when around vehicle used areas and the lake caches are not next to the water and you will have several feet if they get away from you. Most to all the cache should not take long to find depending on your expertise.V1p3rx and I have worked to make the series fun and not finding the same old thing over and over. You will find a couple different styles of hides and also one that is maybe not be the expected way to retrieve the cache from the rest of the series. Stealth may be required due to being close to trails, or areas people may visit. We have attempted to give you geocover in all areas but it is a park. Please make sure the cache is hidden well when you place it back into its hiding spot. There is a archery range in the area so use caution even though caches are not placed in the area of the archery. Hope you enjoy the area and caches available in the park and this series.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charles (Sparky) Monroe Schulz was born on November 22nd, 1922 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, but grow up in St. Paul Minnesota at the age of 77 he passed away on February 12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 2000 in Santa Rosa, California. Schulz first comic strip was called &lt;em&gt;Li’l Folks and ran from June 1947-January 1950 in the&lt;/em&gt; St. Paul Pioneer Press. In Li’l Folks was the first time Schulz used the name Charlie Brown and he created a dog that also looked much like Snoopy. In May of 1948 Schulz sold the first of his one panel drawing to The Saturday Evening Post. After his Li’l Folks comic strip was dropped in the 1950’s, Schulz went to United Feature Syndicated with the one panel Li’I Folks. Interested in his one panel comic, However Schulz had developed a normal four panel strip and at that time and United Feature Syndicated became interested and decided to publish a four panel comic. Peanuts made its debut on October 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt;, 1950, in seven different newspapers. The popular weekly Sunday page made its first appearance on January 6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 1952. When the Peanuts comic strip was on top, it was published every day in 2,600 papers in 75 countries, 21 languages. In almost 50 years the Peanuts comic strip was produced Schulz drew nearly 18,000 strips. Between the comic strips, merchandise, product endorsement produced revenues of more than 1 billion per year. Schulz’s estimated earrings was 30-40 million annually. The Peanuts comic strip only once why Schulz was alive have reshowings when Schulz went on vacation for five-weeks to celebrate his 75&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; birthday. Schulz never had assistants creating the strip and refused to hire an inker or letterer. On December 14&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; 1999 Schulz announced his retirement due to having several small strokes and a blocked aorta. It was later discovered he had colon cancer that had metastasized. Once Schulz started chemotherapy he was unable to see clearly. Schulz on February 12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 2000 died in his sleep around 9:45 P.M. from colon cancer. The last original Peanuts comic strip was produced the next day on Sunday, February 13&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;. Charles Monroe Schulz is buried in Pleasant Hill Cemetery in Sebastopol, California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:1.6;"&gt;Snoopy-Snoopy had his first appearance on October 4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;span style="line-height:1.6;"&gt;1950 in a comic strip two days after the start of the comic strip. Snoopy was named November 10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:1.6;"&gt;, 1950.  His last appearance was February 13, 2000 in comic strip. Snoopy was first owned by Lila in the film Snoopy Come Home before becoming the pet dog of Charlie Brown in comic strips, movies, and T.V. Snoopy was insipid with an original drawing from Charles M Schulz’s dog named Spike. Snoopy is a beagle that is unable to talk so his thoughts show up in speech balloons which appeared starting on March 16&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:1.6;"&gt;, 1952. Snoopy started out on his hind legs on January 6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:1.6;"&gt;, 1956 ice skating. Snoopy has an imaginary life as an author, College Student know as Joe Cool, and a World War one Flying Ace. Snoopy actions with other peanut gang charters is. Snoopy can’t talk so his thought are shown in speech balloons. His moods are shown by growls, sobs, and laughter. The time Snoopy is able to talk is in You’re a Good Man, Charlie Brown and Snoopy The Musical.  He can’t remember Charlie Browns name, only thinks of him as the round headed kid. Snoopy is always trying to Kiss Lucy on the cheek and stealing the blanket of Linus. Snoopy has seven siblings but only five of whom are in the comic stip. They are said to be Andy, Belle, Marbles, Olaf and Spike, with Spike most often seen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Parking at the dog park, I left my vehicle with two flashlights in hand.  Hey, one can't be too prepared especially when caching at night!  A bit of stumbling around ensued followed by one mad dash back to the car to park it properly once common sense kicked in.  My second approach unveiled the cache container quickly.  With my signature added, I returned to the car for further adventures around Rothwell Park.</groundspeak:text>

I was sitting at home doing not much of anything, when all of a sudden my email pinged. New cache! I hurriedly looked to see where it was, and wouldn't you know it? It was in the place I was in very recently...Moberly! Well, not long after, my email pinged again. Another in Moberly! It pinged again...and again...and AGAIN! All told, I saw eight caches pop up! 

There was no way I was going to let them slide, so I messaged dphickey and asked him if he wanted to go on an epic FTF run with me. At first he said he couldn't go. I knew I was going anyway, so I told him I'd check as I got closer to Columbia. Sure enough, when I got close to town, he said he was able and ready to go! I picked him up and we took off north to Moberly!

This was the first cache of the evening. We parked at the dog park lot and walked to the area the cache was in. After a little tree dodging, the cache was found. Opening it up, we were greeted by a pristine log! One problem, though...neither of us brought an implement to sully the log with out initials! Well, dphickey went back and got a pen and all was saved!

FTF - 1

Thanks for the fun cache! TNLN/SL TFTC!

I was sitting at home wondering where my wife was as she was well over due from work when a new cache published.  As I normally do I sent a message to Arthur and Trillian saying 'hey look new cache'.  Then another popped up, and another and another.  8 in all.  A&amp;T said he'd pick me up if I went out for the FTF with him.  Well the wife was still late so I said go without out me and continued making dinner.  When the wife finally got home, dinner was ready and once I completed dinner I got a message saying A&amp;T was in COMO and wanted to know if I still couldn't go.   Well no excuse now, I was rushing around getting ready for caching in the dark.  Once he picked me up I worked quickly to enter the new cache coords into my old trusty 60CSX from my phone as we raced up 63.  This was the first cache we attempted.  We parked near the dog park and made our way to ground zero in the dark, and A&amp;T made the quick find only to be foiled by him leaving his pen in the car and me leaving mine in my GPS case that I left on the picnic table near the car when I tied my shoes.  Easy enough solution, I made my way back to the table and retrieved my case and pen and we sign the log A&amp;T and DPH.   Thanks for the new cache.</groundspeak:text>

   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This cache is part of the Peanuts Gang series in Rothwell Park and Lion's Beuth park. I have chosen the area because there is many areas you can park and still get to more than one cache by walking and then can get back into your vehicle and park again to get the next set of caches. You can also if you want walk or bike the nice trails in the area to get to most of the caches. There are also many things to do in the park, plan to bring the family and stay for more enjoyment after your cache adventure that will take you to many areas of the park including around the lake which will give you good views. If you do bring your kids please watch them when around vehicle used areas and the lake caches are not next to the water and you will have several feet if they get away from you. Most to all the cache should not take long to find depending on your expertise.V1p3rx and I have worked to make the series fun and not finding the same old thing over and over. You will find a couple different styles of hides and also one that is maybe not be the expected way to retrieve the cache from the rest of the series. Stealth may be required due to being close to trails, or areas people may visit. We have attempted to give you geocover in all areas but it is a park. Please make sure the cache is hidden well when you place it back into its hiding spot. There is a archery range in the area so use caution even though caches are not placed in the area of the archery. Hope you enjoy the area and caches available in the park and this series.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charles (Sparky) Monroe Schulz was born on November 22nd, 1922 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, but grow up in St. Paul Minnesota at the age of 77 he passed away on February 12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 2000 in Santa Rosa, California. Schulz first comic strip was called &lt;em&gt;Li’l Folks and ran from June 1947-January 1950 in the&lt;/em&gt; St. Paul Pioneer Press. In Li’l Folks was the first time Schulz used the name Charlie Brown and he created a dog that also looked much like Snoopy. In May of 1948 Schulz sold the first of his one panel drawing to The Saturday Evening Post. After his Li’l Folks comic strip was dropped in the 1950’s, Schulz went to United Feature Syndicated with the one panel Li’I Folks. Interested in his one panel comic, However Schulz had developed a normal four panel strip and at that time and United Feature Syndicated became interested and decided to publish a four panel comic. Peanuts made its debut on October 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt;, 1950, in seven different newspapers. The popular weekly Sunday page made its first appearance on January 6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 1952. When the Peanuts comic strip was on top, it was published every day in 2,600 papers in 75 countries, 21 languages. In almost 50 years the Peanuts comic strip was produced Schulz drew nearly 18,000 strips. Between the comic strips, merchandise, product endorsement produced revenues of more than 1 billion per year. Schulz’s estimated earrings was 30-40 million annually. The Peanuts comic strip only once why Schulz was alive have reshowings when Schulz went on vacation for five-weeks to celebrate his 75&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; birthday. Schulz never had assistants creating the strip and refused to hire an inker or letterer. On December 14&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; 1999 Schulz announced his retirement due to having several small strokes and a blocked aorta. It was later discovered he had colon cancer that had metastasized. Once Schulz started chemotherapy he was unable to see clearly. Schulz on February 12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 2000 died in his sleep around 9:45 P.M. from colon cancer. The last original Peanuts comic strip was produced the next day on Sunday, February 13&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;. Charles Monroe Schulz is buried in Pleasant Hill Cemetery in Sebastopol, California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charlie Brown-The first time the name Charlie Brown was used was in 1948 in Li’l Folks a comic strip Schulz got his start with. Charlie Browns first appearance was in The Peanuts comic strips was on October 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt;, 1950.  Charlie Browns last appearance in a comic strip was February 13&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 2000.  In a comic strip published on Nov. 3, 1950 suggest that Charlie Brown was born on October 30&lt;sup&gt;th.&lt;/sup&gt; On December 21&lt;sup&gt;st,&lt;/sup&gt; 1950 fans were introduced to Charlie Brows Zig-Zag pattern shirt. On March 6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 1951 Charlie Brown was seen playing baseball, but started out as a catcher. On February 7&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 1951 Charlie Brown was introduced to Violet Gray whom on August 13&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 1951 called Charlie Brown a block head which was the first time this insult was used. On November 14&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of 1951 was the start of Charlie brown being unable to kick a football. Violet Gray was scared that Charlie brown was going to kick her hand and she let go of the football. On January 6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 1952 was the first time Charlie brown was in a Sunday comic strip. March 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; 1952 Lucy Van Pelt was introduced to Charlie Brown. Lucy in the November 16&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 1952 was the first time she prevented Charlie Brown from kicking the football by pulling it away because she did not want to get the football dirty.  In the April 25&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 1952 was the first time Charlie Brown was seen flying a kite in the strip.&lt;/p&gt;

I was sitting at home doing not much of anything, chatting with dphickey about this and that, when he mentioned that he was thinking about a caching run up to Moberly. He wanted to avenge some DNF's, find some new caches and go for a FTF! Well, we teamed up to go accomplish these very goals. I needed a couple he had and he needed a couple I had, so with mutual goals, we set off!

This was one of the DNF's that I needed to avenge. It seemed that dphickey had already found this one, so it was up to me to complete the avenging process for the group. We got to the same parking area we went to last time and I prepared for a hunt. Armed with a better set of coordinates, I found the cache with no problems! I signed the log, happy to have avenged the DNF!

The cache is a bit distant from the posted numbers, so here are the coordinates I used to find the cache. They may not be exact, but they will bring you a lot closer to where the cache will be.

Thanks for the fun cache! TNLN/SL TFTC!

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Rainy Sunday cache run.   Sitting at home with a house full of kids I was beginning to get grumpy.  I logged on to Geocaching.com and browsed around and noticed that there was a cache in Moberly that had not been found yet.   FTF run?   Why not.  Asked the wife if she wanted to go for a drive and after completing a few errands we were off.  After FTF and a find on two other caches in this series I decided to attempt to revenge the DNF I had on a previous visit.   The rain was steady by light and there was much more light than my previous visit but that didn't help much.   GPS pointed me right back to the spot I was in the previous night.   So I did the search as before, expanded it a bit, checked the hint, started over and searched more, expanded even farther...   Finally I decided it was time for a PAF.   Drat the phone number of my source was deleted when my phone had that hiccup....  Searching previous call logs rectified the situation, and the information that the coords may be a bit off was given.  Given new data I focused my search and sure enough the cache was found.  Retrieving it took a bit of work, and a madeshift TOTT that I fashioned out of some debris nearby and cache was in hand and signed.   Replacing the cache took a bit of work but once done all was good and ready for the finder.   This was the last of the day as once again it was getting dark and the other DNF nearby had a muggle parked right at GZ doing who knows what..   Decided to call it a day.   TFTC</groundspeak:text>

Knowing that this cache might be elusive, I approached with some trepidation.  The GPS was mostly ignored as the coordinates pointed to a spot that probably wouldn't conceal a geocache well.  A couple of circles around eventually brought about another bit of inspiration.  A-ha!  There the cache was!  Retrieving it was a fairly interesting process.  Very nice!  With the log signed and all returned as found, I walked back to the car.  The GPS indicated that further caching awaited.  However, after the amount of hiking earlier (and the potential encounter with coyote), I opted to call the day complete.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I was sitting at home doing not much of anything, when all of a sudden my email pinged. New cache! I hurriedly looked to see where it was, and wouldn't you know it? It was in the place I was in very recently...Moberly! Well, not long after, my email pinged again. Another in Moberly! It pinged again...and again...and AGAIN! All told, I saw eight caches pop up! 

There was no way I was going to let them slide, so I messaged dphickey and asked him if he wanted to go on an epic FTF run with me. At first he said he couldn't go. I knew I was going anyway, so I told him I'd check as I got closer to Columbia. Sure enough, when I got close to town, he said he was able and ready to go! I picked him up and we took off north to Moberly!

This was the second cache of the evening. We had a good idea where the cache should have been...that much is certain. Fate, however, decided to play with us. Our GPSr's bouncing between three trees, we couldn't quite get a lock on things. I searched what I felt was the likely spot, but came up with nothing. I like night caching, but caching in the dark adds difficulty to the search, sometimes making an easy hide a lot harder. Oh well...better luck next time!

We search and searched with our flashlights but found no sign.  I expanded my search area as A&amp;T re-examined 3 different spots we searched but again nothing.  It was just too dark for this one.

We're on our way home to see what's happening.. We need to be home, and prepare for the Veteran's 4th Annual, Lighted Christmas Parade, in Vinton, IA., the Thursday evening (6 PM)(it's DARK), before Thanksgiving.. (The VFW and AmVets got this Parade started four years ago).. Our Veterans Foreign Wars (VFW), American Veterans (AmVets), American Legion, and Vinton's Vol. Fire Dept., all get together for this Parade.. LOTS of business owners put in their lighted "floats", etc. Really a VERY Pretty Parade, with all the Christmas lighted entries.. We even have some antique cars and trucks, in the parade.....
BTW, we want to THANK YOU, for your Cache(s) and maybe one day we'll BCNU down the road..

PS The cache was only in a Sandwich bag.. NO TB's... We put all in a cammoed Peanut butter jar, put in a new log, a TB, and hid it back in place.. It is ready to go, for now.. [;)] For NOW, you can get rid of the "Needs Maintenance", red cross...[:D]</groundspeak:text>

   <groundspeak:short_description html="True">Cache should be easy to find. There is a small hill. you will have to get low to find this cache, may even have to get a knee on the ground.</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This cache is part of the Peanuts Gang series in Rothwell Park and Lion's Beuth park. I have chosen the area because there is many areas you can park and still get to more than one cache by walking and then can get back into your vehicle and park again to get the next set of caches. You can also if you want walk or bike the nice trails in the area to get to most of the caches. There are also many things to do in the park, plan to bring the family and stay for more enjoyment after your cache adventure that will take you to many areas of the park including around the lake which will give you good views. If you do bring your kids please watch them when around vehicle used areas and the lake caches are not next to the water and you will have several feet if they get away from you. Most to all the cache should not take long to find depending on your expertise.V1p3rx and I have worked to make the series fun and not finding the same old thing over and over. You will find a couple different styles of hides and also one that is maybe not be the expected way to retrieve the cache from the rest of the series. Stealth may be required due to being close to trails, or areas people may visit. We have attempted to give you geocover in all areas but it is a park. Please make sure the cache is hidden well when you place it back into its hiding spot. There is a archery range in the area so use caution even though caches are not placed in the area of the archery. Hope you enjoy the area and caches available in the park and this series.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charles (Sparky) Monroe Schulz was born on November 22nd, 1922 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, but grow up in St. Paul Minnesota at the age of 77 he passed away on February 12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 2000 in Santa Rosa, California. Schulz first comic strip was called &lt;em&gt;Li’l Folks and ran from June 1947-January 1950 in the&lt;/em&gt; St. Paul Pioneer Press. In Li’l Folks was the first time Schulz used the name Charlie Brown and he created a dog that also looked much like Snoopy. In May of 1948 Schulz sold the first of his one panel drawing to The Saturday Evening Post. After his Li’l Folks comic strip was dropped in the 1950’s, Schulz went to United Feature Syndicated with the one panel Li’I Folks. Interested in his one panel comic, However Schulz had developed a normal four panel strip and at that time and United Feature Syndicated became interested and decided to publish a four panel comic. Peanuts made its debut on October 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt;, 1950, in seven different newspapers. The popular weekly Sunday page made its first appearance on January 6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 1952. When the Peanuts comic strip was on top, it was published every day in 2,600 papers in 75 countries, 21 languages. In almost 50 years the Peanuts comic strip was produced Schulz drew nearly 18,000 strips. Between the comic strips, merchandise, product endorsement produced revenues of more than 1 billion per year. Schulz’s estimated earrings was 30-40 million annually. The Peanuts comic strip only once why Schulz was alive have reshowings when Schulz went on vacation for five-weeks to celebrate his 75&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; birthday. Schulz never had assistants creating the strip and refused to hire an inker or letterer. On December 14&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; 1999 Schulz announced his retirement due to having several small strokes and a blocked aorta. It was later discovered he had colon cancer that had metastasized. Once Schulz started chemotherapy he was unable to see clearly. Schulz on February 12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 2000 died in his sleep around 9:45 P.M. from colon cancer. The last original Peanuts comic strip was produced the next day on Sunday, February 13&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;. Charles Monroe Schulz is buried in Pleasant Hill Cemetery in Sebastopol, California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:1.6;"&gt;Pig Pen-Pig Pen made his first appearance on July 13&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:1.6;"&gt;, 1954 in comic strip and His last appearance was September 8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:1.6;"&gt;, 1999 in a comic strip and in this comic strip and  was the only time that Pig Pen showed shame of being dirty instead of pride like in early comic strips. Pig Pen was most often seen in dirty overalls with a cloud of dust and dirt following him everywhere he goes. Pig Pen refers to the dust and dirt as the dust of ancient civilizations. Despite not being able to stay clean Charlie Brown accepts him for who he is and defends his uncleanliness in one comic strip and then again in A Charlie Brown Christmas. Pig Pen began being seen on T.V. Specials in the 1960’s, and in all four movies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:1.6;"&gt;When Geocaching please respect and follow the rules of the park.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Park is open to the public daily from 5:00 a.m.-11:00 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not damage any of the parks property, tress, or other wildlife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope you enjoy the park and its amenities.  &lt;/p&gt;

Parking was easily obtained nearby as a pair of gentleman were working at the youth complex.  A short walk brought me close to the coordinates.  Was it just me, or had Moberly spent some decent coin to shape up their park in recent years?  [:D]  A likely hiding place for the cache was discovered, and the find was had soon thereafter.  Well done!</groundspeak:text>

I was sitting at home doing not much of anything, when all of a sudden my email pinged. New cache! I hurriedly looked to see where it was, and wouldn't you know it? It was in the place I was in very recently...Moberly! Well, not long after, my email pinged again. Another in Moberly! It pinged again...and again...and AGAIN! All told, I saw eight caches pop up!

There was no way I was going to let them slide, so I messaged dphickey and asked him if he wanted to go on an epic FTF run with me. At first he said he couldn't go. I knew I was going anyway, so I told him I'd check as I got closer to Columbia. Sure enough, when I got close to town, he said he was able and ready to go! I picked him up and we took off north to Moberly!

This was the seventh cache of the evening. We arrived at the location for this cache and walked cheerily to ground zero. Discussion about the namesake character ensued. One of the easiest caches of the day, it's location was obvious and we made quick work of it. 

FTF-5 DNF-2

Thanks for the fun cache! TNLN/SL TFTC!

   <groundspeak:short_description html="True">You will find this cache just over the train tracks. There is a small train for kids that runs on Sundays during the summer Schedule is on the parks web site if your interested. Depending on your path you take to this cache you should be able to park close enough to the cache and walk a short distance.</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This cache is part of the Peanuts Gang series in Rothwell Park and Lion's Beuth park. I have chosen the area because there is many areas you can park and still get to more than one cache by walking and then can get back into your vehicle and park again to get the next set of caches. You can also if you want walk or bike the nice trails in the area to get to most of the caches. There are also many things to do in the park, plan to bring the family and stay for more enjoyment after your cache adventure that will take you to many areas of the park including around the lake which will give you good views. If you do bring your kids please watch them when around vehicle used areas and the lake caches are not next to the water and you will have several feet if they get away from you. Most to all the cache should not take long to find depending on your expertise.V1p3rx and I have worked to make the series fun and not finding the same old thing over and over. You will find a couple different styles of hides and also one that is maybe not be the expected way to retrieve the cache from the rest of the series. Stealth may be required due to being close to trails, or areas people may visit. We have attempted to give you geocover in all areas but it is a park. Please make sure the cache is hidden well when you place it back into its hiding spot. There is a archery range in the area so use caution even though caches are not placed in the area of the archery. Hope you enjoy the area and caches available in the park and this series.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charles (Sparky) Monroe Schulz was born on November 22nd, 1922 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, but grow up in St. Paul Minnesota at the age of 77 he passed away on February 12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 2000 in Santa Rosa, California. Schulz first comic strip was called &lt;em&gt;Li’l Folks and ran from June 1947-January 1950 in the&lt;/em&gt; St. Paul Pioneer Press. In Li’l Folks was the first time Schulz used the name Charlie Brown and he created a dog that also looked much like Snoopy. In May of 1948 Schulz sold the first of his one panel drawing to The Saturday Evening Post. After his Li’l Folks comic strip was dropped in the 1950’s, Schulz went to United Feature Syndicated with the one panel Li’I Folks. Interested in his one panel comic, However Schulz had developed a normal four panel strip and at that time and United Feature Syndicated became interested and decided to publish a four panel comic. Peanuts made its debut on October 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt;, 1950, in seven different newspapers. The popular weekly Sunday page made its first appearance on January 6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 1952. When the Peanuts comic strip was on top, it was published every day in 2,600 papers in 75 countries, 21 languages. In almost 50 years the Peanuts comic strip was produced Schulz drew nearly 18,000 strips. Between the comic strips, merchandise, product endorsement produced revenues of more than 1 billion per year. Schulz’s estimated earrings was 30-40 million annually. The Peanuts comic strip only once why Schulz was alive have reshowings when Schulz went on vacation for five-weeks to celebrate his 75&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; birthday. Schulz never had assistants creating the strip and refused to hire an inker or letterer. On December 14&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; 1999 Schulz announced his retirement due to having several small strokes and a blocked aorta. It was later discovered he had colon cancer that had metastasized. Once Schulz started chemotherapy he was unable to see clearly. Schulz on February 12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 2000 died in his sleep around 9:45 P.M. from colon cancer. The last original Peanuts comic strip was produced the next day on Sunday, February 13&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;. Charles Monroe Schulz is buried in Pleasant Hill Cemetery in Sebastopol, California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Franklin Armstrong Was introduced July 31&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;, 1968 as the first black charter in the comic strip. His last appearance was November 5&lt;sup&gt;th,&lt;/sup&gt; 1999 until he appeared in The Peanuts Movie on November 6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 2015. He went to school with Peppermint Patty and Marcie in his first story, Charlie Brown and Franklin meet on the beach. His father was a solder in the Vietnam War.  Franklin was introduced to the peanuts gang when a Los Angeles school teacher named Harriet Glickman wrote Schultz in the spring of 1968 asking him to bring a black character to the comic strip. His last name is consider a apocryphal because the only time his last name is talked about is in the T.V. special you’re in the Super Bowl, Charlie Brown. He is only referred as Franklin in the Comic Strip and other T.V. specials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Geocaching please respect and follow the rules of the park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Park is open to the public daily from 5:00 a.m.-11:00 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not damage any of the parks property, tress, or other wildlife.&lt;/p&gt;

So today, with nothing better to do, I decided to run to Moberly and find all the caches I have not found yet in the series and not in the series.  Then Arthur and Trillian texted me and I filled him in on my plans.   We modified our plans for him to join me and grab the caches he needed.    We decided to go after the FTF first.  We made our way up 63 then to the park.   We parked in a familiar area only this time in daylight.   We quickly made our way across the railroad and into the woods.   A&amp;T spotted the cache and after a breif wait for the retreival we had a fresh virgin log.   CO-FTF for us.   After signing in we moved on to the next cache to revenge a DNF.

I was sitting at home doing not much of anything, chatting with dphickey about this and that, when he mentioned that he was thinking about a caching run up to Moberly. He wanted to avenge some DNF's, find some new caches and go for a FTF! Well, we teamed up to go accomplish these very goals. I needed a couple he had and he needed a couple I had, so with mutual goals, we set off!

We decided to go for the FTF attempt first, so this is the one we attacked. We parked in a very similar spot where we got another FTF a week or so ago, and took off toward the cache. The walk was nice and easy and in no time we were at ground zero. Cache was in hand very quickly, and we were delighted to find a blank log! We happily scribbled out FTF initials, put everything back as it was, and took off toward the next cache.

Thanks for the fun cache! TNLN/SL TFTC!

   <groundspeak:short_description html="True">When going for this cache depending if we have had precipitation it could be very muddy. Should be able to stay to the edge without getting in the mud. It also in the summer could be some bush wacking to get to the cache. This is a neat area and saw several animals and signs of them when hiding it. Please respect the campers areas when you start your search for this cache</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This cache is part of the Peanuts Gang series in Rothwell Park and Lion's Beuth park. I have chosen the area because there is many areas you can park and still get to more than one cache by walking and then can get back into your vehicle and park again to get the next set of caches. You can also if you want walk or bike the nice trails in the area to get to most of the caches. There are also many things to do in the park, plan to bring the family and stay for more enjoyment after your cache adventure that will take you to many areas of the park including around the lake which will give you good views. If you do bring your kids please watch them when around vehicle used areas and the lake caches are not next to the water and you will have several feet if they get away from you. Most to all the cache should not take long to find depending on your expertise.V1p3rx and I have worked to make the series fun and not finding the same old thing over and over. You will find a couple different styles of hides and also one that is maybe not be the expected way to retrieve the cache from the rest of the series. Stealth may be required due to being close to trails, or areas people may visit. We have attempted to give you geocover in all areas but it is a park. Please make sure the cache is hidden well when you place it back into its hiding spot. There is a archery range in the area so use caution even though caches are not placed in the area of the archery. Hope you enjoy the area and caches available in the park and this series.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charles (Sparky) Monroe Schulz was born on November 22nd, 1922 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, but grow up in St. Paul Minnesota at the age of 77 he passed away on February 12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 2000 in Santa Rosa, California. Schulz first comic strip was called &lt;em&gt;Li’l Folks and ran from June 1947-January 1950 in the&lt;/em&gt; St. Paul Pioneer Press. In Li’l Folks was the first time Schulz used the name Charlie Brown and he created a dog that also looked much like Snoopy. In May of 1948 Schulz sold the first of his one panel drawing to The Saturday Evening Post. After his Li’l Folks comic strip was dropped in the 1950’s, Schulz went to United Feature Syndicated with the one panel Li’I Folks. Interested in his one panel comic, However Schulz had developed a normal four panel strip and at that time and United Feature Syndicated became interested and decided to publish a four panel comic. Peanuts made its debut on October 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt;, 1950, in seven different newspapers. The popular weekly Sunday page made its first appearance on January 6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 1952. When the Peanuts comic strip was on top, it was published every day in 2,600 papers in 75 countries, 21 languages. In almost 50 years the Peanuts comic strip was produced Schulz drew nearly 18,000 strips. Between the comic strips, merchandise, product endorsement produced revenues of more than 1 billion per year. Schulz’s estimated earrings was 30-40 million annually. The Peanuts comic strip only once why Schulz was alive have reshowings when Schulz went on vacation for five-weeks to celebrate his 75&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; birthday. Schulz never had assistants creating the strip and refused to hire an inker or letterer. On December 14&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; 1999 Schulz announced his retirement due to having several small strokes and a blocked aorta. It was later discovered he had colon cancer that had metastasized. Once Schulz started chemotherapy he was unable to see clearly. Schulz on February 12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 2000 died in his sleep around 9:45 P.M. from colon cancer. The last original Peanuts comic strip was produced the next day on Sunday, February 13&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;. Charles Monroe Schulz is buried in Pleasant Hill Cemetery in Sebastopol, California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schroeder-Made his first appearance in comic strips in May 30&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 1951. On that date he was introduced as a baby. The last appearance was made September 12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 1999 in comic stipes. In 1954 Schroeder birthday was revealed as January 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;. Schroeder is known for being one of Charlie Browns best finds and having Lucy Van Pelt leaning on his Piano as he plays. The Piano idea came from Schulz daughter Meredith's toy Piano and that is when Schroeder was born. The first appearance for the piano was on September 24, 1951.Schroeder’s home address was 1770 James Street because 1770 was the year Beethoven was born. The origin of Schroeder’s name came from Schulz's 1975 book called &lt;em&gt;Peanuts Jubilee&lt;/em&gt;: "Schroeder was named after a young boy Charles Schulz used to caddy for at Highland Park golf course in St. Paul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

I was sitting at home doing not much of anything, when all of a sudden my email pinged. New cache! I hurriedly looked to see where it was, and wouldn't you know it? It was in the place I was in very recently...Moberly! Well, not long after, my email pinged again. Another in Moberly! It pinged again...and again...and AGAIN! All told, I saw eight caches pop up!

There was no way I was going to let them slide, so I messaged dphickey and asked him if he wanted to go on an epic FTF run with me. At first he said he couldn't go. I knew I was going anyway, so I told him I'd check as I got closer to Columbia. Sure enough, when I got close to town, he said he was able and ready to go! I picked him up and we took off north to Moberly!

This was the eighth and final cache of the evening. We arrived at the best location I could find to park and set off into the woods. We walked to and fro and about halfway into the trip, the batteries on my GPSr died! Oh well...here comes the phone! Not my favorite way, but you gotta do what you gotta do. Anyway, we made the journey just fine and found the final pristine log.

FTF-6 DNF-2

Thanks for the fun cache! TNLN/SL TFTC!

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">This was the final of the Peanuts caches that we found tonight.  We parked .21 miles from the cache and made our way to GZ via an access road new the children's train tracks. Then things got tougher as the road veered off and we bushwhacked into the woods at around  .1 mile from the cache.   The closer we got the more I ran into sticker bushes and low hanging branches....   I don't recommend being crazy like some certain cachers who did this at night.   But it's December and I didn't run into any spider webs or pick up any ticks and we were geocaching... so all was good.   Once we got withing 20 feet we saw what we thought would be the spot and sure enough there was stoic piano player with the clean log that we got to put the first signatures on.   All in all a great series and I will definitely return for the 2 DNFS and the 2 or 3 of the other caches in the series that were published earlier.  TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Out caching with Trekto on Out Of Town Tuesday.  Today we traveled to Moberly Missouri and Mexico Missouri.  We picked up over 20 caches with only one DNF.
We stopped at each and every cache and signed each and every log.  Thanks to all of the CO's for placing these caches.

A dedication was passed as I walked to the coordinates for this cache.  It's amazing how much changes in just a few years; I remember this area simply being a field with some sparse trees!  Soon, leaving the path was necessary for finding the cache.  The hide was discovered with little difficulty but required a bit of a stretch to reach.  With the log signed, I returned to the car.

There were three other hides just on the other side of the Christmas light display.  Hmmm . . . how would I get over there?  Soon, I was in line for the light show to scope out potential approaches (and to enjoy the drive).  Who knew that Moberly had a moose crossing or that Santa drove a tractor?  [:P]  It was a nicely put together and enjoyable event.

Coming to the end, I parked and decided to dare walking across the show to the caches.  I darted into the shadows whenever a car approached and soon entered the woods.  A disc golf course pathway was followed but only to a point.  The telltale yips and barks of several coyote caught my attention.  Nope!  There was no way I would risk running into a pack of coyote for a cache.  Those on the other side of the light show would have to wait until another day.</groundspeak:text>

I was sitting at home doing not much of anything, when all of a sudden my email pinged. New cache! I hurriedly looked to see where it was, and wouldn't you know it? It was in the place I was in very recently...Moberly! Well, not long after, my email pinged again. Another in Moberly! It pinged again...and again...and AGAIN! All told, I saw eight caches pop up!

There was no way I was going to let them slide, so I messaged dphickey and asked him if he wanted to go on an epic FTF run with me. At first he said he couldn't go. I knew I was going anyway, so I told him I'd check as I got closer to Columbia. Sure enough, when I got close to town, he said he was able and ready to go! I picked him up and we took off north to Moberly!

This was the sixth cache of the evening. We arrived at the location for this cache and walked cheerily to ground zero. Only a wee bit of looking is what it took to nail this one.

FTF-4 DNF-2

Thanks for the fun cache! TNLN/SL TFTC!

   <groundspeak:short_description html="True">Cache has a small hill around it. There is a gravel loop close for parking just try to stay to the side as others do come down the path, or parking on the blacktop with a short walk can also get you to the cache.</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This cache is part of the Peanuts Gang series in Rothwell Park and Lion's Beuth park. I have chosen the area because there is many areas you can park and still get to more than one cache by walking and then can get back into your vehicle and park again to get the next set of caches. You can also if you want walk or bike the nice trails in the area to get to most of the caches. There are also many things to do in the park, plan to bring the family and stay for more enjoyment after your cache adventure that will take you to many areas of the park including around the lake which will give you good views. If you do bring your kids please watch them when around vehicle used areas and the lake caches are not next to the water and you will have several feet if they get away from you. Most to all the cache should not take long to find depending on your expertise.V1p3rx and I have worked to make the series fun and not finding the same old thing over and over. You will find a couple different styles of hides and also one that is maybe not be the expected way to retrieve the cache from the rest of the series. Stealth may be required due to being close to trails, or areas people may visit. We have attempted to give you geocover in all areas but it is a park. Please make sure the cache is hidden well when you place it back into its hiding spot. There is a archery range in the area so use caution even though caches are not placed in the area of the archery. Hope you enjoy the area and caches available in the park and this series.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charles (Sparky) Monroe Schulz was born on November 22nd, 1922 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, but grow up in St. Paul Minnesota at the age of 77 he passed away on February 12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 2000 in Santa Rosa, California. Schulz first comic strip was called &lt;em&gt;Li’l Folks and ran from June 1947-January 1950 in the&lt;/em&gt; St. Paul Pioneer Press. In Li’l Folks was the first time Schulz used the name Charlie Brown and he created a dog that also looked much like Snoopy. In May of 1948 Schulz sold the first of his one panel drawing to The Saturday Evening Post. After his Li’l Folks comic strip was dropped in the 1950’s, Schulz went to United Feature Syndicated with the one panel Li’I Folks. Interested in his one panel comic, However Schulz had developed a normal four panel strip and at that time and United Feature Syndicated became interested and decided to publish a four panel comic. Peanuts made its debut on October 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt;, 1950, in seven different newspapers. The popular weekly Sunday page made its first appearance on January 6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 1952. When the Peanuts comic strip was on top, it was published every day in 2,600 papers in 75 countries, 21 languages. In almost 50 years the Peanuts comic strip was produced Schulz drew nearly 18,000 strips. Between the comic strips, merchandise, product endorsement produced revenues of more than 1 billion per year. Schulz’s estimated earrings was 30-40 million annually. The Peanuts comic strip only once why Schulz was alive have reshowings when Schulz went on vacation for five-weeks to celebrate his 75&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; birthday. Schulz never had assistants creating the strip and refused to hire an inker or letterer. On December 14&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; 1999 Schulz announced his retirement due to having several small strokes and a blocked aorta. It was later discovered he had colon cancer that had metastasized. Once Schulz started chemotherapy he was unable to see clearly. Schulz on February 12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 2000 died in his sleep around 9:45 P.M. from colon cancer. The last original Peanuts comic strip was produced the next day on Sunday, February 13&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;. Charles Monroe Schulz is buried in Pleasant Hill Cemetery in Sebastopol, California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sally Brown- Sally was talked about in early 1959 before she made her first appearance on August 23&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt;, 1959 and her last appearance was made on February 6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 2000. Sally was born on May 26&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 1959. When Charlie Brown her brother found out from a phone call from the hospital that he was a big brother, he ran out of the house yelling that he had a new baby sister. Sally was not named until June 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt;, 1959. Sally took her first step on August 22&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt;, 1960. After her first steps the next day in the comic strip she fell in love with Linus. She started kindergarten September 5&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; 1962.&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Out caching with Trekto on Out Of Town Tuesday.  Today we traveled to Moberly Missouri and Mexico Missouri.  We picked up over 20 caches with only one DNF.
We stopped at each and every cache and signed each and every log.  Thanks to all of the CO's for placing these caches.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Another FTF run.   All week I've been checking the new Peanuts cache in Moberly to see if anyone found it.  All week it sat.  Amazing.   So today, with nothing better to do, I decided to run to Moberly and find all the caches I have not found yet in the series and not in the series.  Then Arthur and Trillian texted me and I filled him in on my plans.   We modified our plans for him to join me and grab the caches he needed.    After the FTF find, we both wanted to revenge the DNF we had on this on our last FTF trip.   After pulling up and parking A&amp;T started to read Unitzoid's FTF log.  One line in the log made me think that the cache was not in the area we searched before and I immediately started looking for areas that fit the other hides in the series.  Bingo, I spotted it from about 15 feet away.   A quick read of the GPS showed it was about 60 feet off from the posted coords.  I signed the log as A&amp;T took a reading to share for future finders.   TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

I was sitting at home doing not much of anything, chatting with dphickey about this and that, when he mentioned that he was thinking about a caching run up to Moberly. He wanted to avenge some DNF's, find some new caches and go for a FTF! Well, we teamed up to go accomplish these very goals. I needed a couple he had and he needed a couple I had, so with mutual goals, we set off!

This was one of the DNF's that we both needed to avenge. We got to the same parking area we went to last time and prepared to engage in a long hunt. I was barely out of the vehicle, ready to get to business, when all of a sudden dphickey announced he had found it! So quickly? Yes he did! It's like he channeled the cache owner's knowledge. No matter...we signed the log, happy to have avenged the DNF we had earlier.

We noticed the cache was about 60-65 feet away from where ground zero was, so we took a new set of coordinates. They may not be exact, but they will bring you a lot closer to where  the cache will be.

Thanks for the fun cache! TNLN/SL TFTC!

Parking not far from the exit to the Christmas light show, I gathered my gear and began walking to the coordinates for this listing.  The trail kept a steady and straight course; however, my anxiousness won out.  The GPS was followed dutifully across a small hill and back to the aforementioned pathway.  There, I entered the woods and soon arrived at the coordinates.

Brush was pushed aside as an area with several likely spots was partially illuminated by my flashlight.  Considerable time was spent poking, prodding and gently moving around bits of debris.  Finally, a sneaky idea came to mind, and the GPS was ignored entirely.  Almost immediately the cache was discovered some distance away.  Huzzah!  After signing my name to the log, I continued on my trek around the park.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I was sitting at home doing not much of anything, when all of a sudden my email pinged. New cache! I hurriedly looked to see where it was, and wouldn't you know it? It was in the place I was in very recently...Moberly! Well, not long after, my email pinged again. Another in Moberly! It pinged again...and again...and AGAIN! All told, I saw eight caches pop up!

There was no way I was going to let them slide, so I messaged dphickey and asked him if he wanted to go on an epic FTF run with me. At first he said he couldn't go. I knew I was going anyway, so I told him I'd check as I got closer to Columbia. Sure enough, when I got close to town, he said he was able and ready to go! I picked him up and we took off north to Moberly!

This was the fifth cache of the evening. We arrived at the location for this cache and began the search. We searched and we searched. We consulted the hint and that didn't do us much good, since the hint was kind of vague, given the area. After a while, we decided to leave this one to go to the next.

Again the GPSr would not settle and when it did it was not quite near any one spot.  Lot's of hiding places here and finding a micro in the dark.... well just wasn't in our cards tonight.  Searched high and low, in nooks and crannies but little sis was not having any of it for us tonight.  Can't find them all they say but I am guessing I will try again when the sun is up.

   <groundspeak:short_description html="True">Around the back side of the baseball fields it could hold water. This is an easy find you have to deal with some hills to get to this cache depending on your route that you take. You also have rocks in the area.</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This cache is part of the Peanuts Gang series in Rothwell Park and Lion's Beuth park. I have chosen the area because there is many areas you can park and still get to more than one cache by walking and then can get back into your vehicle and park again to get the next set of caches. You can also if you want walk or bike the nice trails in the area to get to most of the caches. There are also many things to do in the park, plan to bring the family and stay for more enjoyment after your cache adventure that will take you to many areas of the park including around the lake which will give you good views. If you do bring your kids please watch them when around vehicle used areas and the lake caches are not next to the water and you will have several feet if they get away from you. Most to all the cache should not take long to find depending on your expertise.V1p3rx and I have worked to make the series fun and not finding the same old thing over and over. You will find a couple different styles of hides and also one that is maybe not be the expected way to retrieve the cache from the rest of the series. Stealth may be required due to being close to trails, or areas people may visit. We have attempted to give you geocover in all areas but it is a park. Please make sure the cache is hidden well when you place it back into its hiding spot. There is a archery range in the area so use caution even though caches are not placed in the area of the archery. Hope you enjoy the area and caches available in the park and this series.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charles (Sparky) Monroe Schulz was born on November 22nd, 1922 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, but grow up in St. Paul Minnesota at the age of 77 he passed away on February 12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 2000 in Santa Rosa, California. Schulz first comic strip was called &lt;em&gt;Li’l Folks and ran from June 1947-January 1950 in the&lt;/em&gt; St. Paul Pioneer Press. In Li’l Folks was the first time Schulz used the name Charlie Brown and he created a dog that also looked much like Snoopy. In May of 1948 Schulz sold the first of his one panel drawing to The Saturday Evening Post. After his Li’l Folks comic strip was dropped in the 1950’s, Schulz went to United Feature Syndicated with the one panel Li’I Folks. Interested in his one panel comic, However Schulz had developed a normal four panel strip and at that time and United Feature Syndicated became interested and decided to publish a four panel comic. Peanuts made its debut on October 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt;, 1950, in seven different newspapers. The popular weekly Sunday page made its first appearance on January 6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 1952. When the Peanuts comic strip was on top, it was published every day in 2,600 papers in 75 countries, 21 languages. In almost 50 years the Peanuts comic strip was produced Schulz drew nearly 18,000 strips. Between the comic strips, merchandise, product endorsement produced revenues of more than 1 billion per year. Schulz’s estimated earrings was 30-40 million annually. The Peanuts comic strip only once why Schulz was alive have reshowings when Schulz went on vacation for five-weeks to celebrate his 75&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; birthday. Schulz never had assistants creating the strip and refused to hire an inker or letterer. On December 14&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; 1999 Schulz announced his retirement due to having several small strokes and a blocked aorta. It was later discovered he had colon cancer that had metastasized. Once Schulz started chemotherapy he was unable to see clearly. Schulz on February 12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 2000 died in his sleep around 9:45 P.M. from colon cancer. The last original Peanuts comic strip was produced the next day on Sunday, February 13&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;. Charles Monroe Schulz is buried in Pleasant Hill Cemetery in Sebastopol, California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linus-Made His first appearance on September 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 1952 and his last appearance was January 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;, 2000. Linus did not have a name until three days after his appearance. Linus was first mention on July 14.  Linus is the middle child and brother to older sister Lucy Van Pelt and younger brother Rerun Van Pelt. He is known to be best friends with Charlie Brown. In 1954 was first year that Linus talked and on June 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;, was shown with his blue blanket and is often sucking on his thumb. Linus created the Great Pumpkin which appears every Halloween at the most sincere pumpkin patch with gifts. Linus is the only one that believes in the Great Pumpkin, but can occasionally convince others the Great Pumpkin is real for a short time.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Geocaching please respect and follow the rules of the park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Park is open to the public daily from 5:00 a.m.-11:00 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not damage any of the parks property, tress, or other wildlife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope you enjoy the park and its amenities. &lt;/p&gt;

I was sitting at home doing not much of anything, when all of a sudden my email pinged. New cache! I hurriedly looked to see where it was, and wouldn't you know it? It was in the place I was in very recently...Moberly! Well, not long after, my email pinged again. Another in Moberly! It pinged again...and again...and AGAIN! All told, I saw eight caches pop up!

There was no way I was going to let them slide, so I messaged dphickey and asked him if he wanted to go on an epic FTF run with me. At first he said he couldn't go. I knew I was going anyway, so I told him I'd check as I got closer to Columbia. Sure enough, when I got close to town, he said he was able and ready to go! I picked him up and we took off north to Moberly!

This was the fourth cache of the evening. I pulled into the park, only to see the gates closed and locked. Looking at the cache page, it said that the park closed at 11 p.m., so we went for it, leaving the car parked at the gate. We walked to the appointed area and I immediately beaded onto a likely spot. Searching high and low yielded nothing until I glanced at another nearby tree where this was hidden. Bingo.

FTF-3 DNF-1

Thanks for the fun cache! TNLN/SL TFTC!

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">CO-FTF with A&amp;T.   After finding the big sister we made our way to the parking area.   The gates to the park were closed which was perplexing so we did a double check on the hours to make sure we were not going in when we were not supposed to.  Hours on the cache page indicated we were well within the hours of the park so we walked the rest of the way in, and after arriving at what appeared to be GZ we came up blank.   Hmm, maybe look around and the flashlight fell on another spot very close by that was not visible in the dark and trees (couldn't see the tree in the forest so to speak) and another quick search found the subject of the cache and his blanket.  We signed the logs and made our way back to the car.  3 Finds 1 DNF   TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Another FTF run.   All week I've been checking the new Peanuts cache in Moberly to see if anyone found it.  All week it sat.  Amazing.   So today, with nothing better to do, I decided to run to Moberly and find all the caches I have not found yet in the series and not in the series.  Then Arthur and Trillian texted me and I filled him in on my plans.   We modified our plans for him to join me and grab the caches he needed.    Finally we arrived at the last cache in the park I had not found.  We made our way down the access road and onto ground zero.  I spotted the telltale tree right off.   Logged the cache and we headed off to another park so A&amp;T could log the last of the Peanuts caches he needed.  TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

I was out and about caching along the I-44 corridor, having just bagged a FTF in St. James, when what do I hear? Dings of emails! New, it's not safe to check them while driving, so at the first convenient spot, I looked to see what was up. Two new caches in Moberly! Well, I figured I was way too far away to even have a possibility to get them, so I reverently passed on them.

Fast forward to today. I was making my rounds on the internet when I checked the geocaching website and lo and behold, the caches were not found yet! What the heck, I figured...let's go for them!

So, I packed up my stuff and took off. In no time, I was there. I got to ground zero just fine and found the container. I had an idea what I was looking for, and my hunch paid off. Nice placement!

Thanks for the fun cache! TNLN/SL TFTC!

   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JOHN MATTHEW BRENNEMAN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEPT. 15,1975 – MAR. 11,2014&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John was born into a family with an older sister Julie, an older brother Jay and  two surprised parents Jim and Judy.  We thought Judy had the flu, not morning sickness.  Given the family tradition, unknowingly established, his first name would have to start with “J” thus John.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John was born and raised in the small town of Santa Maria CA.  He attended Miller Street School for Kindergarten, 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; and 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; Grades.  He started 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; Grade at St. Mary's Catholic School through the 6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Grade.  Then attended Fesler Junior High School for the 7&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Grades and onto St. Joseph High School for four years and Graduation in 1993. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John was a good boy and was not a hard one to raise, but he did have his moments.  When he was three or four he walked through the living room carrying a screw driver toward his room.  When asked why he replied he was going to take apart his sit and spin. Which he did.  Reassembly was performed later by Dad.  He liked to see how things worked and had an aptitude for mechanical and electrical work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John enjoyed sports and excelled as a Junior Bowler and attended State tournaments with his friends on Rancho Bowl teams.  After he grew up and left home he almost always had two bowling balls in the trunk of his car, in case a bowling opportunity materialized.  He took up throwing the Discus in High School and in his Senior year he went to the California Southern Section CIF finals to qualify for the state tournament and missed qualifying by one slot, they took 9 throwers and John finished 10&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; with his best throw of the season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John was a great person and devoted to his friends and family.  He was not lucky in love.  He wanted the dream, but the women he chose did not. He stayed for 5 years with the first love and finally ended it with no children.  He then married a woman with 3 children and was happy to act as their father for 9 years.  Kayla, Alexis and Kenneth (Bubba) Smart were very much loved by John, and were placed with their biological Dad after his second divorce.  However he did get full custody of his children from that marriage , Emily and Matthew.  His greatest joy was the successes of all 5 of the children and he enjoyed sharing their stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John joined the Army in May of 1999, not wanting to go to college at the time, but looking for training he could use in life, plus the benefits of college subsidies he could use later.  He went to a 9 month Medical Equipment Course and was the honor graduate.  Because of his ability to assimilate and retain information, he was able to not only utilize his high school education to advance him in his class, but also to tutored others who were struggling.  John was sent to Kuwait and then into Iraq as a part of the invasion force in 2003.  He left the Army with an honorable discharge in May 2005, because he did not want to be separated from his family in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John then moved his family from his last Military duty station in San Antonio, TX to Columbia, MO, where he worked for Modern Biomedical Services, Inc. in support of the Moberly Regional Medical Center (MRMC).  He was a Bio-Medical Technician there, repairing and maintaining medical equipment within the hospital complex.  He loved his job and the people he worked with both within Modern Biomedical and MRMC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The friends he met through work and outside work, in his community, were important to him and he was always willing and able to lend a helping hand when needed.  He loved to coach discus and found a small school that could use his help.  He also helped coach his children's teams as they began playing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sports.  He was active in helping his children succeed in school and placed a heavy emphasis on the importance of school in them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the help he provided to others was part of his legacy, their help in working him through the rough parts of his life was also  important. The people that knew him always describe him as happy and cheerful to all.  He was moving his life into a better place after his last divorce and his positive attitude was shining through.  It was a tragedy when a drunk driver, going the wrong way on a divided highway, ended his young life on 11 March 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John made the world around him a better place while he was here and no one can ask more than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Late Logging; Catching up on some older logs....

Was in the area with Cribbage Witch - On our frequent route from St. Louis to St Joseph Area and back through KC to visit with the Folks in Maysville and the kids in KC.  We decided to pick up a few caches to give ourselves time to stretch.    Even though the trip was about double the length, Geocaching seemed to make it feel it went twice as fast.    Thanks for putting these out to make our trip more enjoyable today.</groundspeak:text>

Teaming up with Atomic Goat's Breath, we resolved to head north and find whatever caches we encountered on the way!  Our first stop was Moberly.  After locating another cache south of town, this one was next on our list.  The container was readily spotted from the parking area making the find no problem.  Our condolences on your loss; the tree is a nice tribute to your lost coworker.

Day 2 of my Midwest Journey to Geowoodstock XII from Des Moines, IA.  Today I started in Ottumwa, IA with some foggy weather and got into some rather stormy conditions as I made my way into Missouri.  Eventually I punched through a line of thunderstorms while moving west from Edina to Kirksville.  The rest of the day was quite delightful and the weather kept getting better and better before ending in Columbia, MO.  Most of my good friends going to GWS were well on their way to the event and I had hoped to see some on the journey, but I wound up not crossing paths with anyone though I evidently crossed paths with some of my Maryland friends near Macon or Moberly today.  Lots of fun caches to be had today!

Very nice hide, and sorry for your loss.  John was only a few months older than myself and read your memorial on the cache page.  He sounds liek a nice guy and a great loss to the community.  Thank you to John for his service.</groundspeak:text>

Plus I'm trying to get Geowoodstock to be a milestone for me.  Gotta get some numbers before the weekend...

I've always thought a tree is a nice memorial. Something that can be admired more as the years pass.

Thanks for the cache!</groundspeak:text>

### **STATUS UPDATE NEEDED** ###

-------------

Greetings, 

I hate to pop in here like this but from reading the last note or two, I see this cache might need a little attention. It is worrisome when a cache with a successful find history has a string of DNF's. The geocaching community would like to know how it's going here. Is your cache still here, is it being worked on, that sort of thing. When you get a chance, please log onto your page and give everyone an update by posting a note to your cache page.

If it is not disabled already, I will temporarily disable your cache   to give you an opportunity to stop by and check on your cache.

If you haven't had time to check on it by my next check I'll go ahead and archive it then.
If you decide that this project has reached its end you can archive it now to remove it from the active cache database.

When everything is OK again, please remember to enable your cache and post an "Owner Maintenance" log on your cache page. This log removes the "needs maintenance" and allows your cache to be shown in the search results of Pocket Queries. Don't let your cache be filtered out unnecessarily in Pocket Queries by forgetting to reset the attribute!
I want to thank you for the time that you have taken to contribute to Geocaching in the past and I am looking forward to hopefully seeing your cache up and running in the near future.

HOW TO RESPOND IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS
Respond by posting a new Note. Go to the cache page in question, and click on Log Your Visit. Select "Post Note" as the log type, and enter your message. Doing that, I'll know exactly what cache your message pertains to, which will speed the communication process.
If you're reading this as an email, don't reply to the sending address. It won't reach me. Follow the contact instructions above.

Was in the area with Cribbage Witch - On our frequent route from St. Louis to St Joseph Area and back through KC to visit with the Folks in Maysville and the kids in KC.  We decided to pick up a few caches to give ourselves time to stretch.    Even though the trip was about double the length, Geocaching seemed to make it feel it went twice as fast.    Thanks for putting these out to make our trip more enjoyable today.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">wrenberlin and I made the trek to Iowa for another state badge as neither of us had that state. Rainy drive there, snowy drive back. I have family ties to Ottumwa so we concentrated our caches in the area for the most part. After having lunch, caching, visiting grandparents and all around enjoying ourselves, it was time to head back ... in a snow storm ... in the dark ... going 30 MPH on the highway. Needless to say we stopped for the night in Kirksville, MO and decided to local cache in the snow and it turned out to be very fun!

quick and easy smiley to log on the snow trip back to Columbia ... curious as to what was in the backpack ...hmmmm?</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">November Ghost and myself + the geo-pibble decided this Saturday was a good day to find a cache in the great state of Iowa. Yes, that would be the same day a snowstorm was predicted to blow through. Despite logic, our adventurous streak prevailed, and we left from Columbia, MO, early in the day to visit Ottumwa, IA, where November Ghost has family roots. Ottumwa is quite charming! I learned how delicious a canteen lunch is while overhearing the locals discussing the brewing snow. Still un-phased by the talk of ferocious flurries, we spent the afternoon finding many fine caches. Our trip included a visit to Ghost’s past and a test of courage involving climbing up the slippery branches of a tree in the rain. You bet we exchanged some high fives after tackling that one. Around 5 or 6, it finally dawned on us that there was supposed to be some inclement weather on the way. Still, we dilly-dallied at a diner before finally getting out on the road as the sun was setting. Did I mention that I’m from the south, and that I’d never driven through snow before? November Ghost was behind the wheel… but that doesn’t mean he could actually see the road. And neither could I. I don’t think I’ve ever been that terrified due to weather. Now I know what those bumps on the sides of the lane are for! Driving blind proved to be much too stressful, so we stopped in Kirksville, MO for the night (and I found my first cache in the snow!) We made it home safe and sound on Sunday morning, and with a hearty respect for Mother Nature. Many thanks to all of the cachers who placed the hides we found on our trip!

Sunday morning, I woke up to a lovely blanket of snow and took the geo-pibble for a walk in it. Turns out, she loves snow! After a morning meetup at the golden arches for coffee, November Ghost and I took the jeep out to make some fresh tracks through the field of white. There was a backpack on the ground near the cache. And some plastic grocery bags filled with brown lumps. Yeah... thanks for the smiley anyway!</groundspeak:text>

   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Over the last few years our family has had events of joy and sorrow that have called us back to the area. Every time, our extended family takes over this establishment  and the common room at breakfast is more like the family kitchen on a holiday morning when everyone is home.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
On this particular occasion, the subject of Geocaching had come up among a number of us and we had noticed that there was a shortage of caches within close proximity. This is our attempt to begin to remedy that issue.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Our Congratulations to Keynotes for the First To Find on this!.&lt;br /&gt;

Was in the area with Cribbage Witch - On our frequent route from St. Louis to St Joseph Area and back through KC to visit with the Folks in Maysville and the kids in KC.  We decided to pick up a few caches to give ourselves time to stretch.    Even though the trip was about double the length, Geocaching seemed to make it feel it went twice as fast.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">wrenberlin and I made the trek to Iowa for another state badge as neither of us had that state. Rainy drive there, snowy drive back. I have family ties to Ottumwa so we concentrated our caches in the area for the most part. After having lunch, caching, visiting grandparents and all around enjoying ourselves, it was time to head back ... in a snow storm ... in the dark ... going 30 MPH on the highway. Needless to say we stopped for the night in Kirksville, MO and decided to local cache in the snow and it turned out to be very fun!

nice and easy grab for a snowy caching day! TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">November Ghost and myself + the geo-pibble decided this Saturday was a good day to find a cache in the great state of Iowa. Yes, that would be the same day a snowstorm was predicted to blow through. Despite logic, our adventurous streak prevailed, and we left from Columbia, MO, early in the day to visit Ottumwa, IA, where November Ghost has family roots. Ottumwa is quite charming! I learned how delicious a canteen lunch is while overhearing the locals discussing the brewing snow. Still un-phased by the talk of ferocious flurries, we spent the afternoon finding many fine caches. Our trip included a visit to Ghost’s past and a test of courage involving climbing up the slippery branches of a tree in the rain. You bet we exchanged some high fives after tackling that one. Around 5 or 6, it finally dawned on us that there was supposed to be some inclement weather on the way. Still, we dilly-dallied at a diner before finally getting out on the road as the sun was setting. Did I mention that I’m from the south, and that I’d never driven through snow before? November Ghost was behind the wheel… but that doesn’t mean he could actually see the road. And neither could I. I don’t think I’ve ever been that terrified due to weather. Now I know what those bumps on the sides of the lane are for! Driving blind proved to be much too stressful, so we stopped in Kirksville, MO for the night (and I found my first cache in the snow!) We made it home safe and sound on Sunday morning, and with a hearty respect for Mother Nature. Many thanks to all of the cachers who placed the hides we found on our trip!

Sunday morning, I woke up to a lovely blanket of snow and took the geo-pibble for a walk in it. Turns out, she loves snow! After a morning meetup at the golden arches for coffee, November Ghost and I took the jeep out to make some fresh tracks through the field of white. We found this cache with ease, signed the log, and continued on our way home. Thanks for the smiley!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">From Southeast Missouri working on the DeLorme challenge. This is our third day out and today we have been trying to stay ahead of the rain.  It has been a fun trip finding great caches and seeing areas of Missouri I have never been to. 
A great big THANK YOU goes out to everyone for placing these caches and bringing me to some areas that are filled with loads of history!! We have had a blast!!</groundspeak:text>

Making our way back to KC from St. Charles today but taking a scenic route to add a few more counties to the found column. Made quick work of finding and logging this one then it was back on the road to continue the drive home. TNLNSL. Thanks for the cache!</groundspeak:text>

County: Randolph, Missouri
Delorme Grid: MO-030

Day 2 of my Midwest Journey to Geowoodstock XII from Des Moines, IA.  Today I started in Ottumwa, IA with some foggy weather and got into some rather stormy conditions as I made my way into Missouri.  Eventually I punched through a line of thunderstorms while moving west from Edina to Kirksville.  The rest of the day was quite delightful and the weather kept getting better and better before ending in Columbia, MO.  Most of my good friends going to GWS were well on their way to the event and I had hoped to see some on the journey, but I wound up not crossing paths with anyone though I evidently crossed paths with some of my Maryland friends near Macon or Moberly today.  Lots of fun caches to be had today!

Typical P&amp;G style of cache.  Not a whole lot happening in the immediate vicinity during my mid-afternoon visit.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I think there must be one of these types of caches in every town. I guessed what type it would be by looking at a map. I spotted the hiding place from over a mile a way, but there were lingering muggles everywhere. Eventually, there were just two, workers who seemed more intent on cleaning out the beer bottles and cans from the back of their truck than trying to figure out what I was doing. This was by far the noisiest and most difficult of all of it's type that I've tried to retrieve. It really added character and challenge to the cache.</groundspeak:text>

We're on our way home to see what's happening.. We need to be home, and prepare for the Veteran's 4th Annual, Lighted Christmas Parade, in Vinton, IA., the Thursday evening (6 PM)(it's DARK), before Thanksgiving.. (The VFW and AmVets got this Parade started four years ago).. Our Veterans Foreign Wars (VFW), American Veterans (AmVets), American Legion, and Vinton's Vol. Fire Dept., all get together for this Parade.. LOTS of business owners put in their lighted "floats", etc. Really a VERY Pretty Parade, with all the Christmas lighted entries.. We even have some antique cars and trucks, in the parade.....
BTW, we want to THANK YOU, for your Cache(s) and maybe one day we'll BCNU down the road..

Was in the area with Cribbage Witch - On our frequent route from St. Louis to St Joseph Area and back through KC to visit with the Folks in Maysville and the kids in KC.  We decided to pick up a few caches to give ourselves time to stretch.    Even though the trip was about double the length, Geocaching seemed to make it feel it went twice as fast.    Thanks for putting these out to make our trip more enjoyable today.</groundspeak:text>

The wife wanted to make a trip to the Central Christian College of the Bible Book Store today, so that made for a good time to pick up a few caches in the Moberly area.   Good use of the description and the hints.  We were able to make the grab and get log signed.  TFTC.

Was in the area with Cribbage Witch - On our frequent route from St. Louis to St Joseph Area and back through KC to visit with the Folks in Maysville and the kids in KC.  We decided to pick up a few caches to give ourselves time to stretch.    Even though the trip was about double the length, Geocaching seemed to make it feel it went twice as fast.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Got an invite from Arthur of Arthur and Trillian to do a geocache run up 63 and around the northern part of Missouri the other day.   Weather prediction was sunny and 50's for the day after Christmas.  I had not been out for a major cache run since July so I got permission from the muggle wife and our adventure was set.  We left before dawn and the plan was to return after sunset.  This was cache 8 for the day.  Signed log team TAD.</groundspeak:text>

I am not gonna lie...we had a lot of fun, toured the northern reaches of our area and found some great caches. This is why I like caching...spending time with people, sharing common interests and a sense of adventure! What an awesome way to spend some time with awesome folks!

This cache was signed as TAD for our group. TNLN/SL Thanks, %OwnerName, for placing this cache and for the fun!

We crossed the road, and each chose the path we thought would be the least muddy. It seemed that there ustabe trains through here and I wondered whether the tracks had been built next to the road or if the road had been paved next to the tracks.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I guess I get the FTSTNL (First To Sign The New Log) award.  We were on a run to the Central Christian College of the Bible Book Store today, so that made for a good time to pick up a few caches in the Moberly area.  The wife was finishing up her Christmas list.   Good use of the description and the hints.  We were able to make the grab and get log signed.  TFTC.

We came there to watch the grandson's team play a baseball tourney at Champions Village in Bellevue. Spending a couple days at Shoemaker's RV Park in Bevier, MO waiting for storms to move on east. Decided to pick up a few caches today while it is not raining, though pretty cool for July 3rd. Cache is in good shape. T-TB L-TB SL Thanks for having this available.

Has a nice visit with CO &amp; friend. Cool store to check out when here.</groundspeak:text>

Was in the area with Cribbage Witch - On our frequent route from St. Louis to St Joseph Area and back through KC to visit with the Folks in Maysville and the kids in KC.  This time we didnt do the KC leg but instead headed back across the state using 36 to Hannibal and down.  We decided to pick up a few caches to give ourselves time to stretch. Even though the trip was about double the length, Geocaching seemed to make it feel it went twice as fast. This was one we found on the return trip...Thanks for putting these out to make our trip more enjoyable today.</groundspeak:text>

Setting sights north, Atomic Goat's Breath and I had a decision to make once in Macon:  east or west?  East was chosen as the route would loop nicely around to other caches we intended to attempt.  Before long, we were in Ten Mile and nimbly seeking the hidden container.  Goat made the find and shared the log.  Once back in place, we returned to the road and further adventures to the west!

City of Maple 1 A.C.E.&lt;br /&gt;
The City of Maples series The town of Macon was first settled by James T. Haley in 1852. However, long before Mr. Haley's arrival, scores of immigrants from Kentucky and Virginia ventured into the region as early as 1829. In 1872, John Beaumont donated 10,000 young maple trees Because of these 10,000 trees, Macon has been named "The City of Maples". The city have seven beautiful and well maintained parks and lakes.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;series 1 of 10 caches. will be in the city parks or around the lakes., around long branch lakes. and some somewhere in the city.   .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
City of Maple 1 A.C.E.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;George Washington appointed the first engineer officers of the Army on June 16, 1775. Long Branch Dam was authorized by Congress in 1965 as a multi-purpose project for water supply, flood control, recreation, downstream water quality and fish/wildlife management. Construction began in 1973 and the dam was placed into operation in 1980. Thank to the rangers for your approval placing this cache&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Was in the area with Cribbage Witch - On our frequent route from St. Louis to St Joseph Area and back through KC to visit with the Folks in Maysville and the kids in KC.  We decided to pick up a few caches to give ourselves time to stretch.    Even though the trip was about double the length, Geocaching seemed to make it feel it went twice as fast.    Thanks for putting these out to make our trip more enjoyable today.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I had a great time on a road trip with Joe Friday and SWAG Dragon.  We left Thursday morning at 4:15 from Colorado and arrived at the hotel in St. Lewis MO 20 hours later.  Caching along the way always seams to make the time go by faster, but also adds 6 hours to the trip.  
We only found 100 caches total including all the events.  Every one of the caches was special for some reason.  I picked up 35+ new counties, several virtuals, larges, Earth caches, letterboxes, and a couple wherigos we even found about 50 waymarks, some benchmarks and some labs caches.  Some highlights of the trip were seeing the arch, seeing a flash mob broken up by police, SWAG Dragon falling flat into a ditch full of stinky water, being at our first Geowoodstock, and exploring some of the rich local history.  I enjoyed seeing some fellow Colorado cachers 1000 miles away.  The answers for the VCs, and ECs are being sent by Joe Friday, OneKindWord or Egnix.  Let me know if I need to sort through the pics and notes and answer myself. We used a group stamp most of the time. Thank you for placing this cache and keeping it going.  I am glad it was a part of the overall experience of going on a road trip to Geowoodstock.</groundspeak:text>

Cribbage witch mentioned that the container I  found appeared to be the original, Although I don't think it was in the correct spot and it was a REACH to get it.  Where I think was supposed to be - was filled with ants.

Was in the area with Cribbage Witch - On our frequent route from St. Louis to St Joseph Area and back through KC to visit with the Folks in Maysville and the kids in KC.  We decided to pick up a few caches to give ourselves time to stretch.    Even though the trip was about double the length, Geocaching seemed to make it feel it went twice as fast.    Thanks for putting these out to make our trip more enjoyable today.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Cooley1103 found a wasp at GZ and encouraged him away for a bit. This should have been easy, and we located the container, but it seemed just out of reach. I'm sure it wasn't intentional, or maybe that super wasp was responsible, but the magnet was actually stuck to the i-beam inside the black bumper! That's a really strong magnet! We tried using the Nuvi's cable to lasso it...then I used my pen...then I used my hand (hoping no wasps were inside) and was able to flip it and pull it to daylight. For a log that was replaced 5 months ago, it's dry and crisp! Thanks for the challenge! We replaced it in it's likely intended location!</groundspeak:text>

Was in the area with Cribbage Witch - On our frequent route from St. Louis to St Joseph Area and back through KC to visit with the Folks in Maysville and the kids in KC.  We decided to pick up a few caches to give ourselves time to stretch.    Even though the trip was about double the length, Geocaching seemed to make it feel it went twice as fast.    Thanks for putting these out to make our trip more enjoyable today.</groundspeak:text>

Day 2 of my Midwest Journey to Geowoodstock XII from Des Moines, IA.  Today I started in Ottumwa, IA with some foggy weather and got into some rather stormy conditions as I made my way into Missouri.  Eventually I punched through a line of thunderstorms while moving west from Edina to Kirksville.  The rest of the day was quite delightful and the weather kept getting better and better before ending in Columbia, MO.  Most of my good friends going to GWS were well on their way to the event and I had hoped to see some on the journey, but I wound up not crossing paths with anyone though I evidently crossed paths with some of my Maryland friends near Macon or Moberly today.  Lots of fun caches to be had today!

Quick little highway stop on my way from Marceline to Colombia.  TFTC.</groundspeak:text>

Was in the area with Cribbage Witch - On our frequent route from St. Louis to St Joseph Area and back through KC to visit with the Folks in Maysville and the kids in KC.  We decided to pick up a few caches to give ourselves time to stretch.    Even though the trip was about double the length, Geocaching seemed to make it feel it went twice as fast.    Thanks for putting these out to make our trip more enjoyable today.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Antique-nana decided that since I was off work for 2 weeks on shutdown that we should go for a drive &amp; pick up a few new caches &amp; maybe a county or two. I agreed thinking that I could do a few things around the house later in the week &amp; maybe have a couple days just for me the 2nd week. This was last Tuesday (7/8/14)! Little did I know that the counties she wanted to pick up were in Montana, South Dakota, Nebraska, Wyoming Colorado &amp; Kansas. So much for a short day trip &amp; getting a few things done around the house or a few days just for me! Ok, so it was really mostly my idea &amp; she just agreed to tag along as long as I let her try to find all the caches she possibly could !Here's how it really went:I am off work &amp; thought that since neither of us had ever been to North &amp; South Dakota or Montana and she had never been to most of the other states out this way it would be fun to go caching out here. We left last Tuesday &amp; are having a blast going places we have never been, seeing historic places &amp; just places that are different &amp; unusual. To make it even better we are finding all kinds of caches, meeting (unexpectedly) other cachers, trading bugs out, meeting &amp; talking to people we have never met &amp; will probably never meet again. This is what life is all about. I can hardly wait until I retire in another year or so. TN LN SL Thanks so much for making this trip fun with the cache you hid just for us to find!</groundspeak:text>

We were a little leary at first of going past the gate so we read the cache page and saw that we had the okay, WOW! We are so glad we made this cache a stop. Really enjoyed the cemetery, the stones and ornaments around them and took several pics. We have never seen a medal of honor on a monument before and this one was from the Civil War, very cool.  Loved that huge old, unfortunately dead tree.  So glad we stopped in to break up the highway monotony, we really enjoyed this one. Thanks for placing quest4adventure. Getting a favorite from us.

County: Macon, Missouri
Delorme Grid: MO-023

Day 2 of my Midwest Journey to Geowoodstock XII from Des Moines, IA.  Today I started in Ottumwa, IA with some foggy weather and got into some rather stormy conditions as I made my way into Missouri.  Eventually I punched through a line of thunderstorms while moving west from Edina to Kirksville.  The rest of the day was quite delightful and the weather kept getting better and better before ending in Columbia, MO.  Most of my good friends going to GWS were well on their way to the event and I had hoped to see some on the journey, but I wound up not crossing paths with anyone though I evidently crossed paths with some of my Maryland friends near Macon or Moberly today.  Lots of fun caches to be had today!

I wasn't sure of the path to the cache at first, thinking it was private property.  But I took a chance and it led me right back to Martha and the cache.  A large bird lost a significant battle along the pathway by the barn, and most of its carcass was right there and feathers were all over the path for a span of about 150 feet.

Took a moment to spot the cache, but it was in great shape!  TFTC.</groundspeak:text>

I initially had to deal with some rain, but it all cleared up very quickly by the time I got to my first cache. I got a lot of caches today, to say the very least. No matter how many I got today, I had an awesome time just being outdoors and enjoying the weather. This was one of the ones I found, and it helped to create a great experience.

This cache was the 1st of 113 total caches on the day. TNLN/SL Thanks, quest4adventure, for placing this cache and for the fun!

Atomic Goat's Breath and I approached the parking coordinates and decided to chance driving closer.  Goat deftly hopped out of the car and opened the gate for our passage.  It was a bumpy ride to be sure but not enough to deter us.  Once close to the area, we disembarked and carefully sought what we were after.  The find was quick as was the recording of our visit.  Thanks for pointing out this small patch of local history!  After a few photos, we returned from whence we came.

Cache started with a Geocoin and other swag.

This cache is on public property.  No bushwacking required, please replace cache so it can't be seen easily from the many muggles that could be there or drive by.  Not wheelchair accessible but still EASY.

Making my way across the state today picking up caches representing new counties and DeLorme pages for the challenges. Had the option to pick up a few that were a little closer to my main route but couldn't resist swinging a little bit out of the way to get a cache that qualified for the lonely challenge. Didn't have any problems finding the cache but there were a few ants guarding the container. Only took a couple of swipes to get rid of them and it was time to sign the log. Made quick work of replacing the container and getting back on the road again. TNLNSL. Thanks for the cache!</groundspeak:text>

I never could figure out your reference to a "town"???  and MODOT having to replace signs because of the name of the town??   Where's the town?

Having passed up this cache over the years for varying reasons, this day proved to be the one for a visit!  Atomic Goat's Breath and I drove straight from Ten Mile in the hopes that this older hide would still be in good shape.  Parking was easy to find, and, after a brief stroll through the grass, the container was ours.  Nice hiding spot!  Given its age, the geocache was found to be in good shape.  A quick sign to the log saw our return to the car and eventual return to highway 36.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">wrenberlin and I made the trek to Iowa for another state badge as neither of us had that state. Rainy drive there, snowy drive back. I have family ties to Ottumwa so we concentrated our caches in the area for the most part. After having lunch, caching, visiting grandparents and all around enjoying ourselves, it was time to head back ... in a snow storm ... in the dark ... going 30 MPH on the highway. Needless to say we stopped for the night in Kirksville, MO and decided to local cache in the snow and it turned out to be very fun!

this one required hiking through the snow and getting cold feet! The GPS was bouncing us due to the weather but wrenberlin had the cache in short order ... TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">November Ghost and myself + the geo-pibble decided this Saturday was a good day to find a cache in the great state of Iowa. Yes, that would be the same day a snowstorm was predicted to blow through. Despite logic, our adventurous streak prevailed, and we left from Columbia, MO, early in the day to visit Ottumwa, IA, where November Ghost has family roots. Ottumwa is quite charming! I learned how delicious a canteen lunch is while overhearing the locals discussing the brewing snow. Still un-phased by the talk of ferocious flurries, we spent the afternoon finding many fine caches. Our trip included a visit to Ghost’s past and a test of courage involving climbing up the slippery branches of a tree in the rain. You bet we exchanged some high fives after tackling that one. Around 5 or 6, it finally dawned on us that there was supposed to be some inclement weather on the way. Still, we dilly-dallied at a diner before finally getting out on the road as the sun was setting. Did I mention that I’m from the south, and that I’d never driven through snow before? November Ghost was behind the wheel… but that doesn’t mean he could actually see the road. And neither could I. I don’t think I’ve ever been that terrified due to weather. Now I know what those bumps on the sides of the lane are for! Driving blind proved to be much too stressful, so we stopped in Kirksville, MO for the night (and I found my first cache in the snow!) We made it home safe and sound on Sunday morning, and with a hearty respect for Mother Nature. Many thanks to all of the cachers who placed the hides we found on our trip!

Sunday morning, I woke up to a lovely blanket of snow and took the geo-pibble for a walk in it. Turns out, she loves snow! After a morning meetup at the golden arches for coffee, November Ghost and I took the jeep out to make some fresh tracks through the field of white. Finding this cache took a few, but with frozen hands we signed the log. Thanks!</groundspeak:text>

Well, this certainly was new.  Atomic Goat's Breath parked nearby, and the structure was investigated as it was not present during my previous visits.  A bit of walking around left the two of us puzzled.  Fortunately, the cache container was spotted not long thereafter.

Now I only have 5 to go, but they will have to wait.  Also, filled a couple more dates on the calendar and added a few more counties in north central Missouri to the map.  Drove over 700 miles through rain, snow and sun, but it was all worth it for the joy of more smilies!  Thanks to all the CO’s for creating and maintaining these hides for my enjoyment, especially the old ones!  Cache on!

Another quick find, another MO county.  Thanks!!</groundspeak:text>

ScrapLadyS needed a ride-along buddy to go see her son pitch some college baseball, so what better than to make it a georoad trip?  We planned a few dozen caches, but time and distance prevented us from doing all of them.  No worries.  Better to have too many than too few.  This cache was one that we picked up during the weekend.  Thank you for placing it!

Some of these may be logged out of order due to some weird happening with the app.  They aren't in order there.  O.o</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">wrenberlin and I made the trek to Iowa for another state badge as neither of us had that state. Rainy drive there, snowy drive back. I have family ties to Ottumwa so we concentrated our caches in the area for the most part. After having lunch, caching, visiting grandparents and all around enjoying ourselves, it was time to head back ... in a snow storm ... in the dark ... going 30 MPH on the highway. Needless to say we stopped for the night in Kirksville, MO and decided to local cache in the snow and it turned out to be very fun!

perfect for a snowy and cold day! TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">November Ghost and myself + the geo-pibble decided this Saturday was a good day to find a cache in the great state of Iowa. Yes, that would be the same day a snowstorm was predicted to blow through. Despite logic, our adventurous streak prevailed, and we left from Columbia, MO, early in the day to visit Ottumwa, IA, where November Ghost has family roots. Ottumwa is quite charming! I learned how delicious a canteen lunch is while overhearing the locals discussing the brewing snow. Still un-phased by the talk of ferocious flurries, we spent the afternoon finding many fine caches. Our trip included a visit to Ghost’s past and a test of courage involving climbing up the slippery branches of a tree in the rain. You bet we exchanged some high fives after tackling that one. Around 5 or 6, it finally dawned on us that there was supposed to be some inclement weather on the way. Still, we dilly-dallied at a diner before finally getting out on the road as the sun was setting. Did I mention that I’m from the south, and that I’d never driven through snow before? November Ghost was behind the wheel… but that doesn’t mean he could actually see the road. And neither could I. I don’t think I’ve ever been that terrified due to weather. Now I know what those bumps on the sides of the lane are for! Driving blind proved to be much too stressful, so we stopped in Kirksville, MO for the night (and I found my first cache in the snow!) We made it home safe and sound on Sunday morning, and with a hearty respect for Mother Nature. Many thanks to all of the cachers who placed the hides we found on our trip!

Sunday morning, I woke up to a lovely blanket of snow and took the geo-pibble for a walk in it. Turns out, she loves snow! After a morning meetup at the golden arches for coffee, November Ghost and I took the jeep out to make some fresh tracks through the field of white. This park-n-grab was a fun find today. Thanks!</groundspeak:text>

The cache was sitting out in plain sight, and I saw it from quite a distance as I was walking up the lane. I signed the log and placed it back where it appears it should go and a little more out of sight. TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

This day seemed replete with recent memories.  Both Atomic Goat's Breath and I had visited the train viewing platform at different times in the past; our return ensured that a new cache would be found.  [;)]  Another visitor stayed in his truck and didn't seem to pay mind to our searching around the area.  Ideas on hiding places were tossed back and forth (one with a certain wry humor), and the cache was discovered in good shape.  We returned to the car just in time as a trio of new arrivals soon set upon their own explorations.

Took nothing, left nothing.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Got an invite from Arthur of Arthur and Trillian to do a geocache run up 63 and around the northern part of Missouri the other day.   Weather prediction was sunny and 50's for the day after Christmas.  I had not been out for a major cache run since July so I got permission from the muggle wife and our adventure was set.  We left before dawn and the plan was to return after sunset.  This was cache 22 for the day.  
  I was at this spot previously for a cache back in 2011 when I made the trip to MOGA.   I guess A&amp;T DNFd that cache on that same day but he was able to find this cache today.   Coords were off about 20 feet to towards the latrines...  All three of our GPSr zeroed out there.   Signed log team TAD. TFTC.</groundspeak:text>

I am not gonna lie...we had a lot of fun, toured the northern reaches of our area and found some great caches. This is why I like caching...spending time with people, sharing common interests and a sense of adventure! What an awesome way to spend some time with awesome folks!

This cache was signed as TAD for our group. TNLN/SL Thanks, %OwnerName, for placing this cache and for the fun!

This cache really lived up to it's name. It took us quite a while to find. GZ led us between the gas tank and the womens' outhouse. The cache was about 20 or 30 feet away. It wasn't enough just to search for the cache. We had to walk around and enjoy the sights. A trains horn blew in the distance, but after waiting a while we gave up on seeing it and moved on, but the train was down the line. TFTC
