&lt;br /&gt;
The bank has been robbed by a band of outlaws. They have stolen the
safe. It is your job as a gunslinger to take the bad guys out and
recover the safe for the bank.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Be careful as there are innocent folk roaming the streets as well.
If you do not shoot all of the outlaws, they may take cover in one
of their hideouts. If so, you will have to find their hideout and
take them down! Don't shoot at too many civilians or you may
hang!&lt;br /&gt;

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">We have done quite a few wherigos and this is one of the best we have done! We were a bit worried that maybe we did not have the correct cartridge at first but we continued. Fortunately being a week night, there were not many people around to watch us wander around seemingly aimlessly. We apparently shot the right guys and went after the final. At first we had trouble spotting it and we were going to soon lose our daylight. But we managed to find it securely in place. A favorite for sure! I'll have to see if the technology gods will allow me to upload the finished cartridge. TFTC</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Bruised #9 (5:25 PM) - Find Number 2600!

Unlike a prior visit to Mark Twain Lake, this area was closed for the season.  I parked just next to the gate, suited up and prepared to undertake this Wherigo.  A truck approached just as I was about to cross inquiring if everything was alright.  Reassurances were made, and, once the coast was clear, I again embarked for the campground.

Three deer were grazing near the top of the hill and starting point for the Wherigo. They were amazingly calm as I pulled out the GPS and began following its instructions.  The cartridge was very well put together and many familiar faces were spied as locations were visited.  One point brought me very close to the deer who then ran off.  As their hooves clacked against the pavement, I could only help but feel transported into the era of the Wherigo.  Very cool indeed.

Eventually, a final location was given.  A cautious entry was made into the wood as the sun had just set and nightfall was upon me.  The cache was found in great shape keeping out of sight.  A lengthy signing commenced, and all was replaced as discovered.  Thanks for a memorable milestone and a great adventure!

My original log: Very Cool!!!! I really didn't know what to expect but was excited to hear a wherigo came out. I got the cart last night, and was all set to find that safe today. It was fun, and everyone will be happy to know I didn't hit any of the bystander's. I kind of wish I would have started it all over again to see what would happen if I didn't shoot one of the outlaw's. I nailed them all on the first shoot. Kind of funny, was heading to the starting point and just following the arrow. Dumb!! But I stumbled on to one of the kid's caches, At least that's what I think it was.

Thanks for a really neat cache. I really enjoyed it. I will have to upload the pic of my ringing the bell. . I still have to try and figrue out how to log it on the wherigo site.

Sweet paint job too by the way!!!

I had attempted this Wherigo a while back but armed with a newer iPhone today I had better luck.  This was really fun and I'm glad I was able to play it properly.  It took me about 25 minutes to complete and sign the log...but I was a really good shot.  This cache qualifies for the MO Lonely Cache Challenge.  When I signed my name after JSMTech I thought I had a really lonely cache but I guess I didn't notice where the next three cachers signed in the log book.  Cache is in great shape, fav point awarded!  TNLN SL TFTC!

This was a great whereigo!  It was very nicely done.  I'm glad the campground wasn't too busy - we looked pretty funny wandering around in circles.

We completed the cartridge and didn't see a container near the GZ so we thought maybe there wasn't one since there isn't always a physical container with whereigos.  After reading past logs, looks like we need to go back and look for it.  We'll take care of that tomorrow.

I did get to play the cartridge all the way through to the final but the iPhone zoned out on me when it was time to actually go to the final.  I learned that the iPhone also doesn't shoot very well :(   I had a blast playing the game anyway, thanks Fried Okra!  I know it took a lot of time to set this one up.  There were some very shady characters in the game and one VERY familiar Train Depot!

Thanks, FRIED OKRA!  I really enjoyed playing the Wherigo with Super_cacher and Fuzzy B.  We consulted each other on all the shots.  I really had a hard time when it came to Paul Newman and Robert Redford!  It was the first Wherigo for the guys and I think they enjoyed it, and we enjoyed watching people play it from our campsite!

This cache is dedicated to "Mr. Geotastic", as I like to call him, on his return home. (hopefully for the last time)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;center&gt;&lt;font face="comic sans ms" color="#339900" size="4"&gt;Not only is he the person that introduced me to geocaching, but he was my Battle Buddy during our deployment together in support of OIF 07-08.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.geocaching.com/profile/?guid=120349e5-4309-4be4-bf23-e64f1d75bf98&amp;amp;wid=6d422c9f-6bb9-4885-a292-17b01749b382&amp;amp;ds=2"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/large/43ef76e9-d797-49b8-bc0f-78cd148682cf.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;font size="3"&gt;The battle buddy system is a procedure in which two Soldiers operate together as a team so that they are able to monitor and help each other. The main purpose of the system is improved safety and well-being. Each soldier may prevent the other from becoming a casualty, physically or mentally. These Soldiers often refer to each other as "Battle".&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;font face="comic sans ms" color="#339900" size="4"&gt;This cache is an ammo can. It is full of Army themed swag and several other items young children might like. Feel free to take any of the toys for your own children or grandchildren.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biotite&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biotite is a name used for a large group of black mica minerals that are commonly found in igneous and metamorphic rocks. Biotite is a common phyllosilicate mineral within the mica group; more generally, it refers to the dark mica series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="border:1px solid #A4A4A4;border-radius:20px;padding:20px;margin-bottom:20px;"&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Granite&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, granite is made of large mineral grains (which is where its name came from) that fit tightly together. Second, granite always consists of the minerals quartz and feldspar, with or without a wide variety of other minerals (accessory minerals). The quartz and feldspar generally give granite a light color, ranging from pinkish to white. That light background color is punctuated by the darker accessory minerals. Thus classic granite has a "salt-and-pepper" look. The most common accessory minerals are the black mica biotite and sometimes black amphibole hornblende.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biotite, Feldspar, and Quartz as seen in granite&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are going to be looking at the tomestone of "Nicy M." her granite memorial stone has some big pieces of Biotite on the etched wording side. These are usually large and hardly seen this big within granite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The text "GC6HP67 Biotite" on the first line&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where are the three largest pieces of Biotite located on the grave stone?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;(i.e. behind “N”, below “T” and to the right of “W”)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What size is the largest Biotite mineral?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;(A Centimeter ruler comes in handy here)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

Figured I might as well have some fun until I see the credit card slip (Oh, BTW, she did find a beautiful dress).    We came down the Jackson/ Cape area to get FTF on the Earthcache challenge nearby.     This was the first one after logging our FTF.   We love the old cemeteries!   Gathered the necessary information (Which Eravau submitted for both of us).    Thanks Stearman5!    I give all my Earthcaches logged a favorite point, and this will no exception.</groundspeak:text>

After being first to log the nearby challenge… we headed over to look at this cache. It's always interesting to find earth science lessons in a place you normally wouldn't associate with that.

   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;August 20 is International Geocaching Day. It is a fitting occasion to honor a local cacher who is ranked #5 in the world. The 100K milestone occurred earlier this year, and the actual count now is comfortably higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will have a brief informal program shortly after 5:00 PM. Otherwise, sign the log. Visit with friends   Come and go as you wish.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The event should qualify for a souvenir in your profile. It was confusing last year, but, this year, International Geocaching Day 2016 is on the list of day specific souvenirs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The location, the Spotted Cow, is best known for ice cream and has a sandwich menu as well. It is ADA accessible.&lt;/p&gt;

Time: 5:00 PM to 6:30 PM&lt;br /&gt;

Even during a time when my Dad was in a wheel chair, he would still wheel himself out and play. This cache is a celebration of all the battles and fun many have had here. The cache attempts to put you in the place of many who have come before you engaging in the games.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>

You can take the parts of the cache with you, if you would like as you advance on your mission, just make sure you return them to where you found them in order to avoid hindering the progress of future cachers. At the first way point you will need to search a 10 foot radius. Your mission if you choose to accept it, is to find the ammunition stash, equip for battle and defend the final position, to claim victory. This cache begins with an uphill battle in which you will have to use stealth to traverse difficult terrain undetected, to the ammunition and equipment stash. After you are fully equipped make your way to the final battle front to claim your victory. &lt;br /&gt;

MrsRando60 drove the command vehicle and stayed with it at the parking coordinates while Sami and I hit the woods for an adventure. We descended down into the grand ravine and climbed up the other side. We found the small arms cache after a short walk. We retrieved the information needed to find the ammo cache. After a short walk and a little air warfare we retrieved the ammo. We opened it and found a blank log to sign. TFTC</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">**Day 8** The whole idea for this trip with jREST started about two years ago.  A couple of challenges caches came out that required one to find a lot of counties between the Mexican and Canadian borders, and another between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans.  We discussed a variety of options and finely had some dates and a plan in place.  Our trip consisted of driving from Minnesota to Jacksonville, FL; over to New Orleans, LA; and then back north following the Mississippi River.  We managed to complete the three primary goals of this mission plus some secondary ones.  My car ended up with 4225 miles on it.  We found caches in 123 counties and 14 states. I ended up with 293 finds and 18 DNFs over the nine days.  All in all in was a great trip with a great friend.

Today we started in Hernando, MS and drove 489 miles to Bloomsdale, MO for the night.  We found 30 caches and 4 DNFs in 18 counties.  We had to start getting picky with our caches today.  Almost done with the trip and we still are a ways from home.  Given what was on the agenda, we actually managed to find 6 different icons in 6 different states today.  That qualified me for a challenge cache I signed a few months ago.  I like it when a plan comes together.  We took a meandering route in order to hit some high priority targets and made it to a safe spot to spend the night.

This cache was the entire reason for a detour to Martin.  It was not on our way, but a webcam is enough to draw us over here.  We figured out where to stand and had to us cell phone technology in order to get a picture.  I am sure glad it is the weekend.  This is our fifth one of the trip.  It makes me smile.  Pun intended.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">A road trip that started out as a wild idea to complete the Great River Road challenge, a cache started by King Boreas in Minneapolis... It grew to an epic 10-day adventure with Boreal Walker to string together as many connected counties as we could on our way from Minneapolis to Florida, back across to Louisiana, and then back north to Minneapolis...

Turned into a great adventure, snagged a good grip of caches: Ended up with 123-counties and if my math is correct; 157 traditional's, 98 virtual's, 24 earth caches, 9 multi's, 9 puzzles, 6 letter boxes, 5 webcams, and 4 WIG...  Oh yeah, and 18 DNF's

This was one of the several on our list... Thanks for setting this one up. SWEET, another webcam.  Will go a long way out of the way to stop for one of these, and this was just one of those times.  Got to GZ, realized we needed to go to a different spot, found that one, and the camera was working!!!  Got a couple of photos, and then headed on our way.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Today was day 2 of our trip south from NW Illinois to New Orleans for the Sugar Bowl. As we headed south out of Kentucky into Tennessee, I knew that we would be passing REALLY close to this webcam cache - how could I not stop?!? We were dealing with torrential downpours on and off all morning long and I got really lucky that there was a brief break in the rains and I was only misted upon as I walked towards the familiar scenery of the quiet college campus. My phone had absolutely no links to click on for any webcams (which I screen-captured and will upload) so I did as many have done before me and took a selfie with the camera in the background. My other picture is of the camera itself with my geo-mobile visible in the background.

I love finding webcams and this is my 9th in 7 different states (I'd have Missouri too if the cameras hadn't been locked down before Geowoodstock[:(].)

While planning the trip I see a webcam and that it was set up by my ol' friend Titansfan so I had to make it part of my loop back home. We talked about this cache and that I might have to do a selfie before I made it over this way. Though I like to try and get them from the cam, I took the shot here being and old friend. Best part of the visit is that Titansfan made his way to town so that we could have a lunch together. Great to see you once again friend! TFTC

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Checking out TN webcams, I found this one *** IS WORKING ***. 

However, it uses Java, which the majority of smartphones won't run, AND, due to increased security in the current Java version, 3 url's must be added to Java's "Exception Site List" in the Java Control Panel (after installing Java on your PC) to get past the security measures and view the webcam footage. These are:
'http://www.utm.edu/about/webcams/libcam1.php'
'http://libcam1.utm.edu/-wvdoc-01-/LiveApplet/LiveApplet.zip'
'http://libcam1.utm.edu/-wvdoc-01-/LiveApplet/ImageMap.gif'

(without the quotes)

Computers with an old version of Java installed may not require exceptions to be added. Be prepared, setup Java before you visit and phone someone at the computer for webcam photo capture.

Thanks Titansfan for keeping this one active. I may not actually get here to score a 'find' myself but it's good to see a working webcam.

We found 20 webcam caches, 8 year 2000 caches and a bunch of virtuals and favourited caches.  It was one of the best caching trips I've went on and such a fun adventure.

I teamed up with bflentje, PurpleSquirrel1, lkvlemnguy, GeoBex, JodiBee and MuddaJay, loaded up our two geo-vehicles, and headed down to Jackson, Missouri to attend MOGA 2015. It was an epic journey as we found over 300 caches and 12 events in 5 days and covered 1900 miles of road. We found at least a dozen types of caches as well. This was only my second Mega event and my first MOGA. Huge thanks to all the CO's who placed these caches for us to find and especially to all of the MOGA team for placing literally hundreds of new caches in the Jackson, MO area. We were able to complete all of the geo-art. We signed the micros as MN/WI as some of our team was from MN and some from WI.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Found this cache with I hunt for fun and Solokrieger as we made our way home from Geowoodstock XII in St. Charles, MO. We took the non-direct route (of course) picking up counties, interesting caches, and a few power trails along the way. In total we found around 600 caches during the jam-packed 5 day, 2700 mile trip.

So many selfies! Thought we might have to resort to that as well, but Solokrieger worked his magic on IHHF's tablet and we manged to get the webcam working! We got disconnected, but I took a picture of the webcam photo on the tablet with my iPhone. Isn't technology just great? [:D]

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Mrs I hunt for fun, zanna and I stopped by on day four of the GeoWoodstock XII road trip to take our picture and I played around with Mrs I hunt for fun's tablet on the way to GZ until I got the webcam working on it.

Zanna took a picture of the webcam feed shown on Mrs I hunt for fun's tablet while it showed all three of us which is great because she will have to upload it since at the time I was finally able to save the picture I had to refresh and the ladies were already on the way back to the parking lot which is the reason why in my uploaded picture you only see me [;)]

Like with our road trips in the past zanna did not necessarily plan the fastest and most direct route to our destination GeoWoodstock XII and back to Atlanta but one that brought us through many different counties, states and past many different geocaches and Mrs I hunt for fun's geocachemobile mastered all the paved and gravel roads without any problems [:)]

Thanks to zanna for the planning, Mrs I hunt for fun for providing the geocachemobile, to both for all the fun and the great time and of course the CO for creating this nice webcam cache.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Another cache found on what would be a long weekend of a county cache run. See the picture and description if issues we had under CaverScott's log.

I made a two day, two state, 36 county, 1124 mile cache run that began at 0530 Saturday morning and didn't end until 2230 Sunday evening with CaverScott (CS) and CanUCacheThis (CUCT). I was the driver while they navigated and planned the route (respectively) for us. The trip allowed me to add some more counties to my list for both Mississippi and Tennessee. While this trip had a lot of road time a good time was had by all as we traveled the back country and stopped for some local cuisine.

My count for the weekend would total 48 Traditionals, 20 EarthCaches, 7 Letterboxes, 5 Mysteries, 4 Virtuals, and 1 Webcam.

Thanks for placing and maintaining the caches for us to find and enjoy.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">[red]After weeks of planning today was the day to put the plan into action. The plan was very aggressive and we knew we would have two long days ahead of us. The plan was to complete at least 3 Mississippi Counties and 31 Tennessee Counties in two days. I had lots of Earthcaches on the list and we knew going in that would add extra time to our trip.

We autigerman, CaverScott and I left Winfield around 7:30 a.m. and headed northwest to Mississippi and the west side of Tennessee finding caches and coloring our county maps along the way! Thank you for keeping this webcam active for us to find.  Not too many of these around anymore.  

TRIP STATS:
I. 37 Counties Visited
a. 1 Alabama County
b. 5 Mississippi Counties
c. 31 Tennessee Counties
II. 1,082 Total Miles Traveled
III. Average Speed 44 mph
X. Gas = less than $100 bucks
XI. Hotel = $93

Caches Found: (1) Webcam, (4) Virtuals, (5) Mystery/Puzzles, (7) Letterboxes, (21) Earthcaches and (46) Traditionals[/red]</groundspeak:text>

Day Two:
 
Yesterday, I left my house at 5:30 am Saturday morning and joined AUTigerman at 6:00 am in Fultondale (AL). We then drove to Winfield (AL) to pick up CanUCacheThis (CUCT) at 7:20 am. With the crew assembled we embarked on an aggressive journey. CUCT and I would nab a few needed caches to complete the Mississippi County Challenge and then we would head into Tennessee in hopes of cleaning all the counties west of I65 that we needed. We would overnight near UT Martin arriving after 11:00 pm

After 1,120 miles of “windshield time” we would finish our trip successfully. On Saturday we visited 20 unique counties of which 5 were in Mississippi and 15 in Tennessee. On Sunday, we would find at least one cache in another 15 counties. 

I would log 45 Traditionals, 7 Letterboxes, 21 Earthcaches, 4 Virtuals, and 1 webcam. 

Thank you for listing this cache! Photos loaded!

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Webcam #15.  This one took us a little longer as the PAF did not have the right software setup and our mobile setup was giving us fits.  Eventually I was able to get things linked together so we were able to get the shot.  Always nice to get one of these rare birds (and we got four this weekend).

After a couple of month delay due to conflicting schedules, the Big Muddy River Run was finally a go. Our group consisting of Moldslug, The Wandering Wierdos, and myself made our way south with two primary goals, the Back Home Again Series in Indiana and making our way to Memphis on the weekend. With a bit of tweaking to the route plan we accomplished both goals stringing counties together the whole way. We met up at White Pigeon, Michigan early Thursday morning and returned Sunday evening. Over the course of the 1808 mile trip, we had a few good memorable moments from an unexpected waterfall to being filmed in a British documentary thing for a roadside stop in Indiana, had some good food (including some ribs in Memphis), and see a bit more of the country. For my own stats, I was able to add 46 new counties, 3 new states (Arkansas, Mississippi, and Missouri), 9 virtuals, 4 webcams, a couple of really old caches, and in the end add 220 smileys to my resume. Caches were signed either using our own names, Big Muddy River Run, MRR, or BMRR. Thanks to the owners for placing and maintaining the caches we found. TFTC.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">The "Big Muddy River Run" was a go! After finally being able to coordinate schedules, Allenite, Moldslug and myself were finally able to get this trip going. The plan was to get as many counties as we could on a trip to Memphis, TN and also get the Back Home in Indiana series for Moldslug &amp; Allenite. With some careful planning by Moldslug and Allenite, we made our journey through 71 counties in 7 states, were able to get 17 Virtual caches, 4 Webcam caches, 3 Earthcaches, 1 Multi cache and and a whole bunch of traditional caches. My personal numbers were lower than the other two because I had previously done the B. H. A. series, but I was able to add 59 new counties, 5 new states (Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi, Arkansas and Missouri), filled in 3 of my 6 remaining Jasmer challege dates and got a First to find in Tennessee. We were even filmed by a UK independent film company as we arrived at a roadside Virtual cache in Indiana.

Thanks to all of the CO's who placed these caches and are keeping them active for our enjoyment of finding them.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I joined forces with Allenite and The Wandering Wierdos for a special cache crash weekend we called the ‘Big Muddy River Run’ where we started in Michigan and ran down to Indiana with the ‘Back Home Again’ series as a warmup. After that we headed south across the Ohio River to Kentucky and down one side of the Mississippi River to Memphis for a rib dinner and a pitcher of Ghost River beer on Beale Street, and then back up the other side grabbing every county along the way. Although we each ended up with slightly different numbers based on previous individual trips, our totals included 7 states, 81 counties, 4 webcams, 17 virtuals, 3 earthcaches, 128 blue squigglies, and we were asked to do a bit part in a movie with a crew from London, England filming the Blue Flash roller coaster. We included GCC6 ‘Turkey Run Stash’ in Indiana to Tennessee’s first GC132 ‘LPS001’and filled several Jasmer spots while grabbing a few other older caches too. On Saturday we grabbed six of the states; Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi, Arkansas, and Missouri. On Sunday we chased tornados up I-57 through Illinois and saw three overturned semi’s, plus a camper and utility trailer flipped on the highway and finally a large debris field made from several barns that crossed the highway ahead of us, but we still got our caches! We saw everything from bald eagles to a leopard, and waterfalls to an Elvis impersonator, and had quite a few smileys in between with an FTF in Tennessee thrown in to boot. Whew….

No one was able to pull the camera or program up on their phone so 4 of us started calling cacher friends to see who was home at a computer to take our picture. While we were finding a couple caches after the GOWT/RVG social we had several people working in getting to the webcam and all were were getting  was "the link doesn't work" or "It's not doing anything" or "I can't get it" so we were discouraged but not giving up. I contacted The Musician and sicked him on the job. He saw where the link was supposed to be pointing and he hunted until he found the UTM webcams. So by the time we got to campus he was telling us what he was seeing as he clicked through the cameras. Finally he named two things he could see and we headed toward the fountain until he said he could see us. We were all looking at the wrong camera but I think it made a very unique photo with all of us waving at the wrong camera. Thanks of the cache and the challenge. Camera link needs to be updated because it now goes to a an error page. 
Thanks goes to the Musician for all the help. In the picture is GEO.JOE,Adventuretrekkerr, Justin(?), Fairy Flirt Formykidz and 2 of the Kidz.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Find #7644. Out with Norvina and Molly on a 10 day, 14 state, 4500 mile geocaching journey. This was a nice find while on our way headed back home. We love webcams and love them more when they cooperate. Unfortunately, getting Java to cooperate on my laptop was the struggle here but after 15 minutes of screwing around it came to life. Photos to be uploaded. TFTC.</groundspeak:text>

After having to pass on the Beale St. webcams, we were extra glad to enlist the help of our friends, especially Dutchlandian in The Netherlands, and capture a photo here to make it a seven-icon day. We met a very nice student and fellow cacher here, too. Thanks for keeping this rare cache type alive. TFTwebcam, Titansfan!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">DinaWorks, Kerrillb, Chargeman and I embarked on an epic 7 State Challenge where we needed to get at least two caches in each state. We chose to get two Non-Traditional caches as well as targeting other interesting types of caches (i.e. webcams, earthcaches and challenges). Oh, did I mention we had to do it in one calendar day?

Our last cache of the state before heading on into Kentucky. Maybe we'll visit again as we were chatting up a student about the cache in the area. Wish we had more time. Thanks to our friend in the Netherlands for grabbing the image. TFTC Titansfan</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">IrishCubsFan and I hit this cache on a major weekend roadtrip south. Just about every cache we hit was meaningful to one challenge or another. We grabbed this one because we are always very happy to throw a few non-traditionals into the mix, especially a webcam.

Our good friend was the photographer of the day from her home in Chicago.  TFTC</groundspeak:text>
