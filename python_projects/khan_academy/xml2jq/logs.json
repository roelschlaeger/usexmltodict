[:P]  Parking was easily obtained close to the coordinates, and a short walk saw me there quickly.  Some manner of looking about was needed to procure this particular stash.  A keen eye spotted the container, and all was good.  I contemplated finding a couple more west of Columbia; however, there were tasks awaiting that could not be put off . . . like dinner . . .\n\nThank you for all the work you've put into researching and publishing this series.  While my logs centered around the journey and discovery, learning more about the insect world around us was stupendous!"

The event went off without a hitch and the conditions couldn't have been better. The great weather continued into the afternoon, when it was at this point that I decided to go after these new caches.\n\nI saw one pop up the night before, but I was too pooped to go after it, having already traveled to Marshall, Sedalia, Jeff City and back home. No matter...another cacher got the well-earned FTF. Early this morning, however, I noticed five more caches publish. Hmmm...better get to work on them. I got all but one solved, and that one was quickly rectified after I got a tip from the cache owner. Solving them was all I could do, though, because I had an event to attend.\n\nAfter the event was over and we were heading back home, I noticed that the caches had remained unfound. What the heck, I thought...let's go for them! Best case scenario, I get a few FTF's and cache on a gorgeous day...worst case, I still get to cache on a gorgeous day! So, I loaded up the GPSr and scooted off down the road.\n\nThis cache was the first of the new caches I went after. As I neared the area of ground zero, I kinda had an idea where it might be. I was wrong just a bit. The second place I looked held the container. I opened it up and was pleased to find a blank log, which I dutifully marred in the FTF spot. I put it back and set out for the next one.\n\nThanks for placing this cache for everyone, myself included, to enjoy! TNLN/SL TFTC!\n\nYes, we know where our towels are...\n\n-Fulton, MO"
