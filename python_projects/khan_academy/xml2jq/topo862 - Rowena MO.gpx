&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;font face="arial"&gt;&lt;font color="red"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="5"&gt;DAYLIGHT CACHING ONLY -- SOME AREAS CLOSED AFTER DARK&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="blue"&gt;&lt;b&gt;During this tour you will visit a few heroes, a modest work of modern art, a place for kiddos to play, a quiet place to relax, and you might even meet a fellow geocacher&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p align="justify"&gt;&lt;font face="arial"&gt;&lt;font color="purple"&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;b&gt;There are several stages to this multi-cache. At each stage, except for the final, you will merely find the coordinates to the next stage. All of the stages are simple P&amp;amp;G's&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="justify"&gt;&lt;font face="arial"&gt;&lt;font color="red"&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Most of the stages of this cache are in high muggle areas. PLEASE use you best stealth techniques.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="justify"&gt;&lt;font face="arial"&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;b&gt;The town is named after the small creek that runs south of town and empties into the Missouri River near Portland. It is said that the creek was named by the Lewis and Clark Expedition and is a French term that roughly translates into "Mirey Place" or "Muddy Hole".&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="justify"&gt;&lt;font face="arial"&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Before you set out, you must learn to properly pronounce the name of this quiet little bedroom community, or at least pronounce it the way the locals do. I, like most other long time residents, have heard a wide range of first attempts at pronouncing Auxvasse. The task is actually quite simple. The easiest way I have found to explain it is:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="justify"&gt;&lt;font face="arial"&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Think of the very popular Judy Garland flick "The Wizard of Oz". Now, just drop "The Wizard" and say "Of Oz". There you have it.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;font face="arial"&gt;&lt;font color="green"&gt;&lt;font size="8"&gt;&lt;b&gt;AUXVASSE = OF OZ&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="justify"&gt;&lt;font face="arial"&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;b&gt;The first stop on the tour takes you to a place where many of the heroes from this quiet hamlet are honored.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://i1011.photobucket.com/albums/af236/PawPawGreybeard/DSC_0294.jpg.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://i1011.photobucket.com/albums/af236/PawPawGreybeard/DSC_0294.jpg" border="0" alt=" photo DSC_0294.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="justify"&gt;&lt;font face="arial"&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;b&gt;A.H. Dohman Park is named after a long time, much beloved, town doctor. His life was tragically cut too short for many of the current long time residents of Auxvasse.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://i1011.photobucket.com/albums/af236/PawPawGreybeard/DSC_0287.jpg.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://i1011.photobucket.com/albums/af236/PawPawGreybeard/DSC_0287.jpg" border="0" alt=" photo DSC_0287.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="justify"&gt;&lt;font face="arial"&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Next we have a modest attempt at modern art, well it's at least as artful as some of that you might find in a New York City or other more cosmopolitan city park. It is actually a portion of the water tower that served town for many years. After it was deemed too unsafe to remain standing and too expensive to restore, several members of the local Lions Club worked to save this re-purposed portion.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://i1011.photobucket.com/albums/af236/PawPawGreybeard/DSC_0289.jpg.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://i1011.photobucket.com/albums/af236/PawPawGreybeard/DSC_0289.jpg" border="0" alt=" photo DSC_0289.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="justify"&gt;&lt;font face="arial"&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;b&gt;The next stop on the tour takes your to Mottaz Park on Main St., next to City Hall. It is the site of a building once owned by Waldo Mottaz and served the community in several ways from automobile dealership to grocery store for many years. After its demolition, the remaining concrete pad was converted into the park you see now.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://s1011.photobucket.com/user/PawPawGreybeard/media/mottazparkone.jpg.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://i1011.photobucket.com/albums/af236/PawPawGreybeard/mottazparkone.jpg" border="0" alt=" photo mottazparkone.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="justify"&gt;&lt;font face="arial"&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Finally you come to the last stage. It is placed in the front yard of our modest home. You are looking for a camouflaged ammo can that has been filled with the normal start-up swag, "TORTY" the traveler, and a FTF Gift.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="justify"&gt;&lt;font face="arial"&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;b&gt;If you see one of us out and about in the yard, introduce yourself.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;font face="arial"&gt;&lt;font color="green"&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Permissions for placing this cache was obtained from:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;font face="arial"&gt;&lt;font color="green"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Missy Hooks, City Clerk&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;font face="arial"&gt;&lt;font color="green"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Donal Knipp, Auxvasse Lions Club&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;font face="arial"&gt;&lt;font color="green"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;b&gt;HoneyBeeMawMaw, The Boss&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;font face="arial"&gt;&lt;font color="blue"&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;b&gt;CONGRATULATIONS TO ARTHUR &amp;amp; TRILLIAN FOR THE FTF!!!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Third multicache attempt for the day, second find of the day.  I had solved all but the final of this from home just from the pictures, but somehow, I lost my notes, so I started from scratch in the field today.  The first stage was no problem at all, either finding or reading.  It was then off two stage two.  Stage two was no problem to find, but was a little hard to read.  It could be made out, but barely, and I was soon on my way to stage three.  Stage three was a bit hard to spot, but once spotted, easy to read, and it was off to stage four.  Stage four shouldn't have been a problem to find, but it took me a few minutes before I spotted the container.  Once in hand, a quick photo was taken, and I was on my way to the final.  I parked WAY too far from the final, but as I was walking around, trying to look nonchalant, like I'm just taking tricorder readings or something, I think I may have seen HoneyBeeMawMaw looking at me as she made her way to her abode.  At that time, I didn't yet know where the cache was, although I was almost right on top of it.  A few moments later, and I had the "Duh" moment, signed the log, and recorded the TBs in the cache.  Thank you for placing this multi, PawPawGreyBeaard &amp; HoneyBeeMawMaw!  I enjoyed this one!</groundspeak:text>

The first 3 were a piece of cake, though the writing on the 2nd stage is VERY faded and hard to read - needs to have some owner maintenance with a Sharpie.  However, when we got to #4, we got stopped.  Going to have to ask for a hint on this one, because we WILL be back.</groundspeak:text>

At the finale, the homeowners were home and I often make mistakes typing in coordinates so I was concerned I might not be in the right place. Luckily I was and I was able to say hi and ink mine and Weadog1's name on the log. I love getting to tour the town via a multi! Thanks for placing this one!!!</groundspeak:text>

Ah, Auxvasse!  Memories of my early geocaching days came flooding back as this town had been visited a few times before.  This particular arrival would be slightly different:  a multi-cache of some renown would be pursued.  Timing was essential as storm clouds were beginning to roll in.  I set upon the first stage and found it toot-sweet.  Armed with new coordinates, the second and third were swiftly approached and dispatched.  The fourth was where the challenge lay!  Some determined sleuthing was needed.  Eventually, feeling around brought forth the container with the final set of coordinates.  Huzzah!

Driving to the final location, I parked and was immediately greeted by a friendly cat.  Also greeting me were the occupants of a nearby house.  Introductions were given and my activity explained.  With their blessings, I set forth to discovered the cache container.  My name and a brief log entry were added to the logbook.  Swapping trackables, I returned to the car and contemplated where to go next.

Thank you for this wonderfully put together multi-cache!  It provided a great tour of Auxvasse and reminded me why I got into this crazy, but fun, sport.  [:D]

Stage 3 took a little longer- had to look a bit before spotting it. It was starting to rain at this point, but we kept looking and finally got it- blends in well. Stage 4 took us the longest time. We searched for over 20 minutes in the rain. We almost gave up, but then took one more sweep in a place we had looked, but it blends in so well that I actually found it more by feel. So glad we found it! The final was soon found- a nice big cache! Left a TB I brought back from Geowoodstock. This was a lot of fun and very satisfying to complete. Thanks for setting it up and for the little tour around town! Earns a favorite point from me!</groundspeak:text>

Then we found the first two stages quickly. The third stage wasn't obvious, but the coordinates were good and we found what we needed, centered and low.

The fourth stage defeated us. The two of us spent about 35 minutes there. The GPSr lead us in circles. The readings took us to the north end of the fence, the bench, and the NE corner of the gazebo.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Spotted cache listing while getting ready to visit Mexico, MO while eating lunch today.  Well, heck yeah, that's just right up the road.  Off we went, however we had several places we needed to stop and shop at before we could even get started visiting all the picture points.  First stop, we had never been here before, 2nd stop, low and behold this is right across the street from my sister's house so we knew the area well. 3rd stop this one took some time it blended in so well. Hint: Just stop and look for white.  4th stop, this one  took us quite a while to locate. It started raining and we used the gazebo for shelter to wait it out. Finally, after getting drenched we resorted to PAF, yep, we admit it, but we got it and off to the final.  As we circled 'round, someone spotted us from the front window, out stepped the CO, "busted" I said.  "Haha".  Great set up, we enjoyed even after getting wet from the much needed rained.  Difficulty rating probably should be raised to at least a 1.5 maybe even 2. Sign caused us some problems as well as the gazebo, we don't think either one are walk ups.  
Thanks PawPawGreybeard for the multi, we're using it for the 7 souvenirs of August. Nice talking with you on the porch this afternoon. Thanks for trading swag.</groundspeak:text>

The final cache of the day and what a great way to end the run!

I arrived in Auxvasse after doing the Ford Series and quickly got to work at the first stage. After quickly getting the coordinates, I set out for the next stage. A bit of looking there yielded the third. It took a minute of thinking to find the right road to the art, but I prevailed and found what I needed there. Those numbers led me to the park. This was the toughest stage for me. I looked a few minutes before I saw what I was looking for. You certainly have to think of all possibilities. 

Armed with the numbers to the final, I took off to that location. I arrived there and all was still. Not a creature stirring. A quick search found the final container and yes...I was elated to find that clean log book! I signed that bad boy, took the FTF prize (Thank you very much for it, by the way!) and the trackable and set off for home.

This was a very well done multi cache. Thanks for giving me a mini tour of Auxvasse via this cache. You earn a favorite point for it. Great job! T: FTF prize and trackable L: My siggy. TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

With day's end and storm clouds rapidly approaching, some expediency was required if any further caching was to commence!  This was the next closest hide from Auxvasse and promised to fulfill the requirements of a "park and grab".  I drove north and soon found myself at the coordinates.  The car was parked just out of the way, and the search was on.  Within a few moments, the cache was in hand and the log signed.  Nice!  Once the container was back in place, it was evident that I needed to beat feet back to Columbia.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">(#3,408) I was out caching my way home from Geocoinfest in Omaha, Nebraska… and had run into the owner of this cache while there. I mentioned that I had one county that I wanted to pick up on my way home today. When he asked… I named Audrain County… and he mentioned that he had this cache [b]right[/b] on the county line. He thought it fell [b]just[/b] inside of Audrain County… but suggested I check before I rely on his memory since it was so close to the line. I never got around to checking… but decided to give it a shot anyway. So I got off of I-70 and headed up highway 54 to ground zero. After pulling into the cut-over road between the north and southbound lanes… I hopped out of my car and found the cache in the first place I looked (after waiting for the passing traffic to clear). I signed the log and dropped in one of my signature miniature, marbled dice. Then I waited for all the traffic to pass again and put the cache back where I found it. Thanks for the hide… and for saving me a few miles of driving into Audrain County, Arthur &amp; Trillian!</groundspeak:text>

Knowing Of A Tree&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a good thing indeed&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When someone plants a seed&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And to watch and help it grow&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So someday, it to be a tree.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It is a good thing in truth&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When a tree brings forth its fruit&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Or to shade someone's head&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Or its branch be a robins nest.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It is good when a tree is used&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
By nature, or by me or you&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To protect or shelter lives&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For a tree; it never dies.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A tree is someone's home&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A tree is someone's good book&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A tree is never alone,&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For to know a tree, all you do; is look.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It is good to plant a tree&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It is good to plant a seed&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For someday it will be grown&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And a tree, will be known.&lt;/p&gt;

I think both the terrain and level of difficulty need to be raised on this one. Difficulty should probably be a least a 4. This one was extremely difficult to find. Be patient and don't give up, it is indeed out there. Look low and not high is the only advice I will toss out.</groundspeak:text>

Please read the historic marker to learn more about the part Mexico, Missouri played in the Civil War 150 plus years ago, A total of four will be placed, this marker was erected in 2015. Marker 2 and 3 were placed recently in 2016. The final marker will be placed in 2017, by the Audrain Historical Society. You will need a pen and possibly tweezers to secure the paper for logging.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Militarly, Mexico was important because of the railroad. Railroads were vital methods of transportation for manpower and material during the war. The North Missouri Railroad ran from St. Charles, MO. to Mexico and then on to Macon, MO where it joined the Hannibal and St. Joseph railroads. The only line that crossed the entire breadth of the State. Both sides recognized the strategic benefits of controlling this part of NE Missouri.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early in the war several Union army units were sent across from Illinois to help secure the State for the Union. One of the units was the 21st IL. Infantry commanded by Colonel Ulysses S. Grant, who camped here in Mexico from July 20 to August 7, 1861. While in this area Col. Grant visited Graceland Mansion which was buildt in 1857 by John P. Clark. Now listed on the registry of historic places, and hosted by the Audrain Historical Society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The antibellum mansion is open for tours of house and grounds if interested.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Trillian and I were at Fulton High School, wrapping things up after Young Zaphod and his fellow Hornets had concluded their tennis meet up with the Boonville Pirates. Packing away my chair, I heard a loud PING! 

New email! 

Lemme just go check it out. A new cache, eh? No wait...not just one...not even two. Three new ones!Hmmmm...they are up in my hometown of Mexico! Daylight is starting to fade, but just maybe I might be able to go get them! So, after some convincing of Trillian to let me go, punctuated with a promise of a gift of chocolate to her, she allowed me to go. I dropped Trillian and Young Zaphod off at home and took off toward Mexico.

After finishing the second cache, I went for this, the final cache of the evening. I got to the area just fine and, per the typical style I had experienced, I went to the spot and had cache in hand. Opening it up, I found yet another clean log sheet. Signing that FTF spot completed my FTF hat trick for the evening. I put everything back and headed for home, quite satisfied with this little cache run. Thanks for the series!

You get a favorite point for the awesome historical aspect of the cache. Thanks for placing this cache for everyone, myself included, to enjoy. TNLN/SL

Yes, we know where our towels are...

   <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Once again you will be looking for a Civil War Historic Marker. This is an easy Park and Grab ( bison tube), located in a Cemetery. Be respectful of other persons driving through, but there is parking very close to the cache.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Elmwood Cemetery in Mexico, Missouri is the final resting place to nearly 200 Civil War veterans, Union and Confederate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The marker will direct you to graves of Peter McCullough, "The Hanging Judge of Andersonville Prison". Another cache in this cemetery will explain the importance of his Civil War service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Private Bryon S. HIte, born in Virginia. In 1861 fought in the battles of Springfield, Carthage, and Lexington. 1862 , during Col. Joseph Porters raid, he enlisted with Sniders Battalion of Missouri Cavalry (CSA) and was wounded during Porter's withdrawl  to Arkansas in October 1862. In 1878 Hite patented his "Hite Heat Fender", a ventilation system for cook stoves. He opened a factory in Mexico and accumulated a fortune.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another grave to visit would be Colonel Bazel Lazear who commanded the First Missouri State Militia Cavalry 1863-1964. His regiment chased and lost William Quantrells partisan cavalry during Quantrells Lawrence, Kansas raid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elmwood also contains the graves of two brothers David and Walker Lillard, who served in a MO USCT regiment, and after the war help found the 2nd Missionary Baptist Church.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This marker will contain other stories of Civil War Veterans. A grant from the City of Mexico Parks and Recreation made this marker possible.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Trillian and I were at Fulton High School, wrapping things up after Young Zaphod and his fellow Hornets had concluded their tennis meet up with the Boonville Pirates. Packing away my chair, I heard a loud PING! 

New email! 

Lemme just go check it out. A new cache, eh? No wait...not just one...not even two. Three new ones!Hmmmm...they are up in my hometown of Mexico! Daylight is starting to fade, but just maybe I might be able to go get them! So, after some convincing of Trillian to let me go, punctuated with a promise of a gift of chocolate to her, she allowed me to go. I dropped Trillian and Young Zaphod off at home and took off toward Mexico.

I went after this one first, simply because it was at a cemetery and daylight was starting to leave. I got to the area in time for it to be somewhat light out and before I even stopped the geo-mobile, I had an idea where it was. I hopped out of the car and quickly had cache in hand. Opening it up, I was greeted with a pristine log! Yay! I happily signed the FTF spot, put everything back as it was and headed off to the next cache.

You get a favorite point for the awesome historical aspect of the cache. Thanks for placing this cache for everyone, myself included, to enjoy. TNLN/SL

Yes, we know where our towels are...

   <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Easy Park and Grab located in a very busy grocery store parking lot. Use stealth when finding the cache, if possible. You will be looking for another bison tube. The grocery store owner has given premission for the marker to be placed on his property and a ribbon cutting ceremony was held in April 2016.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;You'll find this marker at a busy parking lot of a local grocery store, but perhaps not as busy as it was back in the summer of 1861. The area was the site of an encampment of about 3000 Union Soldiers, under the direction of Colonel Ulysses S. Grant. It was here in July of 1861 that Colonel Grant learned of his promotion to General. His mission in the area was to protect the North Missouri Railroad, located in Mexico, and to keep the area within the Union.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Missouri was divided between staying in the Union or going to the Confederacy. You will find a star in each battle flag, of that era, claiming Missouri for it's own. Often families and neighbors were split by their decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A dedication of this marker and of marker 2 was held on April 12, 2016, with an informative talk by the President of Audrain Historical Society, Mr. Tony Robertson. Permission to place this cache has been given by Roger Moser, owner of the grocery store.&lt;/p&gt;

Trillian and I were at Fulton High School, wrapping things up after Young Zaphod and his fellow Hornets had concluded their tennis meet up with the Boonville Pirates. Packing away my chair, I heard a loud PING! 

New email! 

Lemme just go check it out. A new cache, eh? No wait...not just one...not even two. Three new ones!Hmmmm...they are up in my hometown of Mexico! Daylight is starting to fade, but just maybe I might be able to go get them! So, after some convincing of Trillian to let me go, punctuated with a promise of a gift of chocolate to her, she allowed me to go. I dropped Trillian and Young Zaphod off at home and took off toward Mexico.

This one was next on my agenda. I drove over from the cemetery and once I got to the area, the site of the marker was illuminated quite brightly. Sensing a theme possibly, I parked the geo-mobile, left the GPSr in the car and went over to the area of the marker to search. I found the cache quickly, Opened it up and found another blank log! I sullied this one up with my FTF signature, put everything back and made my way to the final cache of the evening.

You get a favorite point for the awesome historical aspect of the cache. Thanks for placing this cache for everyone, myself included, to enjoy. TNLN/SL

Yes, we know where our towels are...

&lt;p&gt;Just like the mythological bird this cache is a rebirth of my&lt;br /&gt;
earlier cache, Out With The Old, In With The New. That cache was&lt;br /&gt;
apparently too close to the school and evidently the kids found it&lt;br /&gt;
and decided to take it. After the first cache walked away I&lt;br /&gt;
replaced it…..then it also walked away so I decided it was&lt;br /&gt;
time to throw in the towel. But……it has resurfaced&lt;br /&gt;
again as The Phoenix! Now in a different spot away from prying eyes&lt;br /&gt;
hopefully it will remain undisturbed. I hope everyone enjoys&lt;br /&gt;
finding this cache as much as I enjoyed placing it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to manager Regina for granting permission to place this&lt;br /&gt;
cache.&lt;/p&gt;

This cache made me a bit homesick, as the Phoenix is the symbol for Atlanta, GA, since the city "rose from the ashes" after being burned by Sherman's troops. The hunt for this cache made the find really rewarding! I appreciate a well-crafted container. TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

took us a few minutes to locate this cache, for starters our iGPS was bouncing like mad and taking us all over the place ... I finally got my geo-senses in check and for a small rural town this was a super urban hide container! I totally love these types of containers and creativity! You get a blue ribbon from me!

I've been here two or three times previously, and the last time I was here, I was within inches of the cache location, but caution won out.  After my last visit, I did an EAF, and with armed with a hint, I was able to return with my lovely wife today, and make the grab very quickly.  The biggest problem I had today was that the alley and whole area was iced up and slick as greased owl snot.  The important thing is, though, we made the find and filled in another calendar day.

Ah, the highway!  Never had I been so glad to lay my eyes upon pavement!  Mud-strewn roads were left in favor of a much more solid method of transport.  These miraculous routes brought my vehicle to Sturgeon and this cache listing.  Parking was easy to obtain, and the usual poking about ensued.  This garnered the attention of a man sitting in a business office nearby.  Geocaching was briefly explained (as was my lurking around his door).  He seemed disinterested and didn't say much as I decided to search elsewhere.  [:P]  The cache was indeed a bit of a reach to obtain once spotted.  Very nicely camouflaged!  I signed the log and returned to the car.  There was but one destination remaining:  home.</groundspeak:text>

I found it pretty quickly due to geosenses, but for the general public or a beginner cacher, I could see it being pretty challenging. I am six-four, so reaching it was no issue.

Made the sort of short drive early morning to the little burg of Sturgeon.  I had a suspicion what I would be looking for and I was right.  I'm not a short person, just average, but this one was challenging...especially putting it back!  TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">FTF I didn't want to go straight home after work, so after hitting the Hardee's drive through in Columbia, I drove to Sturgeon hoping to be the first on the scene. With 15% battery life on my phone, and no GPS, I got out of my car and followed my app to the coordinates. It put me in front of building. I read the cache page and adjusted accordingly. I knew what kind of container to look for, but this still took me by surprise. The hint was needed. This cache earns a favorite point for a lack of poison ivy, ticks, thorns, and for all the fun I had trying to obey the speed limit.

One final note. This cache should not be attempted by small children without adult supervision.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Got an invite from Arthur of Arthur and Trillian to do a geocache run up 63 and around the northern part of Missouri the other day.   Weather prediction was sunny and 50's for the day after Christmas.  I had not been out for a major cache run since July so I got permission from the muggle wife and our adventure was set.  We left before dawn and the plan was to return after sunset.  This was cache 1 for the day.</groundspeak:text>

I am not gonna lie...we had a lot of fun, toured the northern reaches of our area and found some great caches. This is why I like caching...spending time with people, sharing common interests and a sense of adventure! What an awesome way to spend some time with awesome folks!

   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JOHN MATTHEW BRENNEMAN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEPT. 15,1975 – MAR. 11,2014&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John was born into a family with an older sister Julie, an older brother Jay and  two surprised parents Jim and Judy.  We thought Judy had the flu, not morning sickness.  Given the family tradition, unknowingly established, his first name would have to start with “J” thus John.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John was born and raised in the small town of Santa Maria CA.  He attended Miller Street School for Kindergarten, 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; and 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; Grades.  He started 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; Grade at St. Mary's Catholic School through the 6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Grade.  Then attended Fesler Junior High School for the 7&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Grades and onto St. Joseph High School for four years and Graduation in 1993. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John was a good boy and was not a hard one to raise, but he did have his moments.  When he was three or four he walked through the living room carrying a screw driver toward his room.  When asked why he replied he was going to take apart his sit and spin. Which he did.  Reassembly was performed later by Dad.  He liked to see how things worked and had an aptitude for mechanical and electrical work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John enjoyed sports and excelled as a Junior Bowler and attended State tournaments with his friends on Rancho Bowl teams.  After he grew up and left home he almost always had two bowling balls in the trunk of his car, in case a bowling opportunity materialized.  He took up throwing the Discus in High School and in his Senior year he went to the California Southern Section CIF finals to qualify for the state tournament and missed qualifying by one slot, they took 9 throwers and John finished 10&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; with his best throw of the season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John was a great person and devoted to his friends and family.  He was not lucky in love.  He wanted the dream, but the women he chose did not. He stayed for 5 years with the first love and finally ended it with no children.  He then married a woman with 3 children and was happy to act as their father for 9 years.  Kayla, Alexis and Kenneth (Bubba) Smart were very much loved by John, and were placed with their biological Dad after his second divorce.  However he did get full custody of his children from that marriage , Emily and Matthew.  His greatest joy was the successes of all 5 of the children and he enjoyed sharing their stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John joined the Army in May of 1999, not wanting to go to college at the time, but looking for training he could use in life, plus the benefits of college subsidies he could use later.  He went to a 9 month Medical Equipment Course and was the honor graduate.  Because of his ability to assimilate and retain information, he was able to not only utilize his high school education to advance him in his class, but also to tutored others who were struggling.  John was sent to Kuwait and then into Iraq as a part of the invasion force in 2003.  He left the Army with an honorable discharge in May 2005, because he did not want to be separated from his family in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John then moved his family from his last Military duty station in San Antonio, TX to Columbia, MO, where he worked for Modern Biomedical Services, Inc. in support of the Moberly Regional Medical Center (MRMC).  He was a Bio-Medical Technician there, repairing and maintaining medical equipment within the hospital complex.  He loved his job and the people he worked with both within Modern Biomedical and MRMC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The friends he met through work and outside work, in his community, were important to him and he was always willing and able to lend a helping hand when needed.  He loved to coach discus and found a small school that could use his help.  He also helped coach his children's teams as they began playing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sports.  He was active in helping his children succeed in school and placed a heavy emphasis on the importance of school in them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the help he provided to others was part of his legacy, their help in working him through the rough parts of his life was also  important. The people that knew him always describe him as happy and cheerful to all.  He was moving his life into a better place after his last divorce and his positive attitude was shining through.  It was a tragedy when a drunk driver, going the wrong way on a divided highway, ended his young life on 11 March 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John made the world around him a better place while he was here and no one can ask more than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

Was in the area with Cribbage Witch - On our frequent route from St. Louis to St Joseph Area and back through KC to visit with the Folks in Maysville and the kids in KC.  We decided to pick up a few caches to give ourselves time to stretch.    Even though the trip was about double the length, Geocaching seemed to make it feel it went twice as fast.    Thanks for putting these out to make our trip more enjoyable today.</groundspeak:text>

Teaming up with Atomic Goat's Breath, we resolved to head north and find whatever caches we encountered on the way!  Our first stop was Moberly.  After locating another cache south of town, this one was next on our list.  The container was readily spotted from the parking area making the find no problem.  Our condolences on your loss; the tree is a nice tribute to your lost coworker.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Got an invite from Arthur of Arthur and Trillian to do a geocache run up 63 and around the northern part of Missouri the other day.   Weather prediction was sunny and 50's for the day after Christmas.  I had not been out for a major cache run since July so I got permission from the muggle wife and our adventure was set.  We left before dawn and the plan was to return after sunset.  This was cache 5 for the day.  The other two spotted this cache from the parking lot.   Signed log team TAD.  TFTC</groundspeak:text>

I am not gonna lie...we had a lot of fun, toured the northern reaches of our area and found some great caches. This is why I like caching...spending time with people, sharing common interests and a sense of adventure! What an awesome way to spend some time with awesome folks!

Day 2 of my Midwest Journey to Geowoodstock XII from Des Moines, IA.  Today I started in Ottumwa, IA with some foggy weather and got into some rather stormy conditions as I made my way into Missouri.  Eventually I punched through a line of thunderstorms while moving west from Edina to Kirksville.  The rest of the day was quite delightful and the weather kept getting better and better before ending in Columbia, MO.  Most of my good friends going to GWS were well on their way to the event and I had hoped to see some on the journey, but I wound up not crossing paths with anyone though I evidently crossed paths with some of my Maryland friends near Macon or Moberly today.  Lots of fun caches to be had today!

Very nice hide, and sorry for your loss.  John was only a few months older than myself and read your memorial on the cache page.  He sounds liek a nice guy and a great loss to the community.  Thank you to John for his service.</groundspeak:text>

Plus I'm trying to get Geowoodstock to be a milestone for me.  Gotta get some numbers before the weekend...

I've always thought a tree is a nice memorial. Something that can be admired more as the years pass.

### **STATUS UPDATE NEEDED** ###

-------------

Greetings, 

I hate to pop in here like this but from reading the last note or two, I see this cache might need a little attention. It is worrisome when a cache with a successful find history has a string of DNF's. The geocaching community would like to know how it's going here. Is your cache still here, is it being worked on, that sort of thing. When you get a chance, please log onto your page and give everyone an update by posting a note to your cache page.

If it is not disabled already, I will temporarily disable your cache   to give you an opportunity to stop by and check on your cache.

If you haven't had time to check on it by my next check I'll go ahead and archive it then.
If you decide that this project has reached its end you can archive it now to remove it from the active cache database.

When everything is OK again, please remember to enable your cache and post an "Owner Maintenance" log on your cache page. This log removes the "needs maintenance" and allows your cache to be shown in the search results of Pocket Queries. Don't let your cache be filtered out unnecessarily in Pocket Queries by forgetting to reset the attribute!
I want to thank you for the time that you have taken to contribute to Geocaching in the past and I am looking forward to hopefully seeing your cache up and running in the near future.

HOW TO RESPOND IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS
Respond by posting a new Note. Go to the cache page in question, and click on Log Your Visit. Select "Post Note" as the log type, and enter your message. Doing that, I'll know exactly what cache your message pertains to, which will speed the communication process.
If you're reading this as an email, don't reply to the sending address. It won't reach me. Follow the contact instructions above.

Was in the area with Cribbage Witch - On our frequent route from St. Louis to St Joseph Area and back through KC to visit with the Folks in Maysville and the kids in KC.  We decided to pick up a few caches to give ourselves time to stretch.    Even though the trip was about double the length, Geocaching seemed to make it feel it went twice as fast.    Thanks for putting these out to make our trip more enjoyable today.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">wrenberlin and I made the trek to Iowa for another state badge as neither of us had that state. Rainy drive there, snowy drive back. I have family ties to Ottumwa so we concentrated our caches in the area for the most part. After having lunch, caching, visiting grandparents and all around enjoying ourselves, it was time to head back ... in a snow storm ... in the dark ... going 30 MPH on the highway. Needless to say we stopped for the night in Kirksville, MO and decided to local cache in the snow and it turned out to be very fun!

quick and easy smiley to log on the snow trip back to Columbia ... curious as to what was in the backpack ...hmmmm?</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">November Ghost and myself + the geo-pibble decided this Saturday was a good day to find a cache in the great state of Iowa. Yes, that would be the same day a snowstorm was predicted to blow through. Despite logic, our adventurous streak prevailed, and we left from Columbia, MO, early in the day to visit Ottumwa, IA, where November Ghost has family roots. Ottumwa is quite charming! I learned how delicious a canteen lunch is while overhearing the locals discussing the brewing snow. Still un-phased by the talk of ferocious flurries, we spent the afternoon finding many fine caches. Our trip included a visit to Ghost’s past and a test of courage involving climbing up the slippery branches of a tree in the rain. You bet we exchanged some high fives after tackling that one. Around 5 or 6, it finally dawned on us that there was supposed to be some inclement weather on the way. Still, we dilly-dallied at a diner before finally getting out on the road as the sun was setting. Did I mention that I’m from the south, and that I’d never driven through snow before? November Ghost was behind the wheel… but that doesn’t mean he could actually see the road. And neither could I. I don’t think I’ve ever been that terrified due to weather. Now I know what those bumps on the sides of the lane are for! Driving blind proved to be much too stressful, so we stopped in Kirksville, MO for the night (and I found my first cache in the snow!) We made it home safe and sound on Sunday morning, and with a hearty respect for Mother Nature. Many thanks to all of the cachers who placed the hides we found on our trip!

Sunday morning, I woke up to a lovely blanket of snow and took the geo-pibble for a walk in it. Turns out, she loves snow! After a morning meetup at the golden arches for coffee, November Ghost and I took the jeep out to make some fresh tracks through the field of white. There was a backpack on the ground near the cache. And some plastic grocery bags filled with brown lumps. Yeah... thanks for the smiley anyway!</groundspeak:text>

   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Over the last few years our family has had events of joy and sorrow that have called us back to the area. Every time, our extended family takes over this establishment  and the common room at breakfast is more like the family kitchen on a holiday morning when everyone is home.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
On this particular occasion, the subject of Geocaching had come up among a number of us and we had noticed that there was a shortage of caches within close proximity. This is our attempt to begin to remedy that issue.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Our Congratulations to Keynotes for the First To Find on this!.&lt;br /&gt;

Was in the area with Cribbage Witch - On our frequent route from St. Louis to St Joseph Area and back through KC to visit with the Folks in Maysville and the kids in KC.  We decided to pick up a few caches to give ourselves time to stretch.    Even though the trip was about double the length, Geocaching seemed to make it feel it went twice as fast.    Thanks for putting these out to make our trip more enjoyable today.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">wrenberlin and I made the trek to Iowa for another state badge as neither of us had that state. Rainy drive there, snowy drive back. I have family ties to Ottumwa so we concentrated our caches in the area for the most part. After having lunch, caching, visiting grandparents and all around enjoying ourselves, it was time to head back ... in a snow storm ... in the dark ... going 30 MPH on the highway. Needless to say we stopped for the night in Kirksville, MO and decided to local cache in the snow and it turned out to be very fun!

nice and easy grab for a snowy caching day! TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">November Ghost and myself + the geo-pibble decided this Saturday was a good day to find a cache in the great state of Iowa. Yes, that would be the same day a snowstorm was predicted to blow through. Despite logic, our adventurous streak prevailed, and we left from Columbia, MO, early in the day to visit Ottumwa, IA, where November Ghost has family roots. Ottumwa is quite charming! I learned how delicious a canteen lunch is while overhearing the locals discussing the brewing snow. Still un-phased by the talk of ferocious flurries, we spent the afternoon finding many fine caches. Our trip included a visit to Ghost’s past and a test of courage involving climbing up the slippery branches of a tree in the rain. You bet we exchanged some high fives after tackling that one. Around 5 or 6, it finally dawned on us that there was supposed to be some inclement weather on the way. Still, we dilly-dallied at a diner before finally getting out on the road as the sun was setting. Did I mention that I’m from the south, and that I’d never driven through snow before? November Ghost was behind the wheel… but that doesn’t mean he could actually see the road. And neither could I. I don’t think I’ve ever been that terrified due to weather. Now I know what those bumps on the sides of the lane are for! Driving blind proved to be much too stressful, so we stopped in Kirksville, MO for the night (and I found my first cache in the snow!) We made it home safe and sound on Sunday morning, and with a hearty respect for Mother Nature. Many thanks to all of the cachers who placed the hides we found on our trip!

Sunday morning, I woke up to a lovely blanket of snow and took the geo-pibble for a walk in it. Turns out, she loves snow! After a morning meetup at the golden arches for coffee, November Ghost and I took the jeep out to make some fresh tracks through the field of white. We found this cache with ease, signed the log, and continued on our way home. Thanks for the smiley!</groundspeak:text>

County: Randolph, Missouri
Delorme Grid: MO-030

Day 2 of my Midwest Journey to Geowoodstock XII from Des Moines, IA.  Today I started in Ottumwa, IA with some foggy weather and got into some rather stormy conditions as I made my way into Missouri.  Eventually I punched through a line of thunderstorms while moving west from Edina to Kirksville.  The rest of the day was quite delightful and the weather kept getting better and better before ending in Columbia, MO.  Most of my good friends going to GWS were well on their way to the event and I had hoped to see some on the journey, but I wound up not crossing paths with anyone though I evidently crossed paths with some of my Maryland friends near Macon or Moberly today.  Lots of fun caches to be had today!

Typical P&amp;G style of cache.  Not a whole lot happening in the immediate vicinity during my mid-afternoon visit.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I think there must be one of these types of caches in every town. I guessed what type it would be by looking at a map. I spotted the hiding place from over a mile a way, but there were lingering muggles everywhere. Eventually, there were just two, workers who seemed more intent on cleaning out the beer bottles and cans from the back of their truck than trying to figure out what I was doing. This was by far the noisiest and most difficult of all of it's type that I've tried to retrieve. It really added character and challenge to the cache.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Hi all,
We're on our way home to see what's happening.. We need to be home, and prepare for the Veteran's 4th Annual, Lighted Christmas Parade, in Vinton, IA., the Thursday evening (6 PM)(it's DARK), before Thanksgiving.. (The VFW and AmVets got this Parade started four years ago).. Our Veterans Foreign Wars (VFW), American Veterans (AmVets), American Legion, and Vinton's Vol. Fire Dept., all get together for this Parade.. LOTS of business owners put in their lighted "floats", etc. Really a VERY Pretty Parade, with all the Christmas lighted entries.. We even have some antique cars and trucks, in the parade.....
BTW, we want to THANK YOU, for your Cache(s) and maybe one day we'll BCNU down the road..

   <groundspeak:short_description html="True">Around the back side of the baseball fields it could hold water. This is an easy find you have to deal with some hills to get to this cache depending on your route that you take. You also have rocks in the area.</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This cache is part of the Peanuts Gang series in Rothwell Park and Lion's Beuth park. I have chosen the area because there is many areas you can park and still get to more than one cache by walking and then can get back into your vehicle and park again to get the next set of caches. You can also if you want walk or bike the nice trails in the area to get to most of the caches. There are also many things to do in the park, plan to bring the family and stay for more enjoyment after your cache adventure that will take you to many areas of the park including around the lake which will give you good views. If you do bring your kids please watch them when around vehicle used areas and the lake caches are not next to the water and you will have several feet if they get away from you. Most to all the cache should not take long to find depending on your expertise.V1p3rx and I have worked to make the series fun and not finding the same old thing over and over. You will find a couple different styles of hides and also one that is maybe not be the expected way to retrieve the cache from the rest of the series. Stealth may be required due to being close to trails, or areas people may visit. We have attempted to give you geocover in all areas but it is a park. Please make sure the cache is hidden well when you place it back into its hiding spot. There is a archery range in the area so use caution even though caches are not placed in the area of the archery. Hope you enjoy the area and caches available in the park and this series.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charles (Sparky) Monroe Schulz was born on November 22nd, 1922 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, but grow up in St. Paul Minnesota at the age of 77 he passed away on February 12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 2000 in Santa Rosa, California.

Schulz’s estimated earrings was 30-40 million annually. The Peanuts comic strip only once why Schulz was alive have reshowings when Schulz went on vacation for five-weeks to celebrate his 75&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; birthday. Schulz never had assistants creating the strip and refused to hire an inker or letterer. On December 14&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; 1999 Schulz announced his retirement due to having several small strokes and a blocked aorta. It was later discovered he had colon cancer that had metastasized. Once Schulz started chemotherapy he was unable to see clearly. Schulz on February 12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 2000 died in his sleep around 9:45 P.M. from colon cancer.

Linus did not have a name until three days after his appearance. Linus was first mention on July 14.  Linus is the middle child and brother to older sister Lucy Van Pelt and younger brother Rerun Van Pelt. He is known to be best friends with Charlie Brown. In 1954 was first year that Linus talked and on June 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;, was shown with his blue blanket and is often sucking on his thumb. Linus created the Great Pumpkin which appears every Halloween at the most sincere pumpkin patch with gifts. Linus is the only one that believes in the Great Pumpkin, but can occasionally convince others the Great Pumpkin is real for a short time.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Geocaching please respect and follow the rules of the park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Park is open to the public daily from 5:00 a.m.-11:00 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not damage any of the parks property, tress, or other wildlife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope you enjoy the park and its amenities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations to Arthur &amp;amp; Trillian &amp;amp; dphicky on Co- FTF&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

I was sitting at home doing not much of anything, when all of a sudden my email pinged. New cache! I hurriedly looked to see where it was, and wouldn't you know it? It was in the place I was in very recently...Moberly! Well, not long after, my email pinged again. Another in Moberly! It pinged again...and again...and AGAIN! All told, I saw eight caches pop up!

There was no way I was going to let them slide, so I messaged dphickey and asked him if he wanted to go on an epic FTF run with me. At first he said he couldn't go. I knew I was going anyway, so I told him I'd check as I got closer to Columbia. Sure enough, when I got close to town, he said he was able and ready to go! I picked him up and we took off north to Moberly!

This was the fourth cache of the evening. I pulled into the park, only to see the gates closed and locked. Looking at the cache page, it said that the park closed at 11 p.m., so we went for it, leaving the car parked at the gate. We walked to the appointed area and I immediately beaded onto a likely spot. Searching high and low yielded nothing until I glanced at another nearby tree where this was hidden. Bingo.

FTF-3 DNF-1

Thanks for the fun cache! TNLN/SL TFTC!

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">CO-FTF with A&amp;T.   After finding the big sister we made our way to the parking area.   The gates to the park were closed which was perplexing so we did a double check on the hours to make sure we were not going in when we were not supposed to.  Hours on the cache page indicated we were well within the hours of the park so we walked the rest of the way in, and after arriving at what appeared to be GZ we came up blank.   Hmm, maybe look around and the flashlight fell on another spot very close by that was not visible in the dark and trees (couldn't see the tree in the forest so to speak) and another quick search found the subject of the cache and his blanket.  We signed the logs and made our way back to the car.  3 Finds 1 DNF   TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

Then Arthur and Trillian texted me and I filled him in on my plans.   We modified our plans for him to join me and grab the caches he needed.    Finally we arrived at the last cache in the park I had not found.  We made our way down the access road and onto ground zero.  I spotted the telltale tree right off.   Logged the cache and we headed off to another park so A&amp;T could log the last of the Peanuts caches he needed.  TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

I was out and about caching along the I-44 corridor, having just bagged a FTF in St. James, when what do I hear? Dings of emails! New, it's not safe to check them while driving, so at the first convenient spot, I looked to see what was up. Two new caches in Moberly! Well, I figured I was way too far away to even have a possibility to get them, so I reverently passed on them.

Fast forward to today. I was making my rounds on the internet when I checked the geocaching website and lo and behold, the caches were not found yet! What the heck, I figured...let's go for them!

So, I packed up my stuff and took off. In no time, I was there. I got to ground zero just fine and found the container. I had an idea what I was looking for, and my hunch paid off. Nice placement!

Thanks for the fun cache! TNLN/SL TFTC!

   <groundspeak:short_description html="True">Cache has a small hill around it. There is a gravel loop close for parking just try to stay to the side as others do come down the path, or parking on the blacktop with a short walk can also get you to the cache.</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This cache is part of the Peanuts Gang series in Rothwell Park and Lion's Beuth park. I have chosen the area because there is many areas you can park and still get to more than one cache by walking and then can get back into your vehicle and park again to get the next set of caches. You can also if you want walk or bike the nice trails in the area to get to most of the caches. There are also many things to do in the park, plan to bring the family and stay for more enjoyment after your cache adventure that will take you to many areas of the park including around the lake which will give you good views. If you do bring your kids please watch them when around vehicle used areas and the lake caches are not next to the water and you will have several feet if they get away from you. Most to all the cache should not take long to find depending on your expertise.V1p3rx and I have worked to make the series fun and not finding the same old thing over and over. You will find a couple different styles of hides and also one that is maybe not be the expected way to retrieve the cache from the rest of the series. Stealth may be required due to being close to trails, or areas people may visit. We have attempted to give you geocover in all areas but it is a park. Please make sure the cache is hidden well when you place it back into its hiding spot. There is a archery range in the area so use caution even though caches are not placed in the area of the archery. Hope you enjoy the area and caches available in the park and this series.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charles (Sparky) Monroe Schulz was born on November 22nd, 1922 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, but grow up in St. Paul Minnesota at the age of 77 he passed away on February 12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 2000 in Santa Rosa, California. Schulz first comic strip was called &lt;em&gt;Li’l Folks and ran from June 1947-January 1950 in the&lt;/em&gt; St. Paul Pioneer Press. In Li’l Folks was the first time Schulz used the name Charlie Brown and he created a dog that also looked much like Snoopy. In May of 1948 Schulz sold the first of his one panel drawing to The Saturday Evening Post. After his Li’l Folks comic strip was dropped in the 1950’s, Schulz went to United Feature Syndicated with the one panel Li’I Folks. Interested in his one panel comic, However Schulz had developed a normal four panel strip and at that time and United Feature Syndicated became interested and decided to publish a four panel comic. Peanuts made its debut on October 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt;, 1950, in seven different newspapers. The popular weekly Sunday page made its first appearance on January 6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 1952. When the Peanuts comic strip was on top, it was published every day in 2,600 papers in 75 countries, 21 languages. In almost 50 years the Peanuts comic strip was produced Schulz drew nearly 18,000 strips. Between the comic strips, merchandise, product endorsement produced revenues of more than 1 billion per year. Schulz’s estimated earrings was 30-40 million annually. The Peanuts comic strip only once why Schulz was alive have reshowings when Schulz went on vacation for five-weeks to celebrate his 75&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; birthday. Schulz never had assistants creating the strip and refused to hire an inker or letterer. On December 14&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; 1999 Schulz announced his retirement due to having several small strokes and a blocked aorta. It was later discovered he had colon cancer that had metastasized. Once Schulz started chemotherapy he was unable to see clearly. Schulz on February 12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 2000 died in his sleep around 9:45 P.M. from colon cancer. The last original Peanuts comic strip was produced the next day on Sunday, February 13&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;. Charles Monroe Schulz is buried in Pleasant Hill Cemetery in Sebastopol, California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sally Brown- Sally was talked about in early 1959 before she made her first appearance on August 23&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt;, 1959 and her last appearance was made on February 6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 2000. Sally was born on May 26&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 1959. When Charlie Brown her brother found out from a phone call from the hospital that he was a big brother, he ran out of the house yelling that he had a new baby sister. Sally was not named until June 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt;, 1959. Sally took her first step on August 22&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt;, 1960. After her first steps the next day in the comic strip she fell in love with Linus. She started kindergarten September 5&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; 1962.&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Another FTF run.   All week I've been checking the new Peanuts cache in Moberly to see if anyone found it.  All week it sat.  Amazing.   So today, with nothing better to do, I decided to run to Moberly and find all the caches I have not found yet in the series and not in the series.  Then Arthur and Trillian texted me and I filled him in on my plans.   We modified our plans for him to join me and grab the caches he needed.    After the FTF find, we both wanted to revenge the DNF we had on this on our last FTF trip.   After pulling up and parking A&amp;T started to read Unitzoid's FTF log.  One line in the log made me think that the cache was not in the area we searched before and I immediately started looking for areas that fit the other hides in the series.  Bingo, I spotted it from about 15 feet away.   A quick read of the GPS showed it was about 60 feet off from the posted coords.  I signed the log as A&amp;T took a reading to share for future finders.   TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

I was sitting at home doing not much of anything, chatting with dphickey about this and that, when he mentioned that he was thinking about a caching run up to Moberly. He wanted to avenge some DNF's, find some new caches and go for a FTF! Well, we teamed up to go accomplish these very goals. I needed a couple he had and he needed a couple I had, so with mutual goals, we set off!

This was one of the DNF's that we both needed to avenge. We got to the same parking area we went to last time and prepared to engage in a long hunt. I was barely out of the vehicle, ready to get to business, when all of a sudden dphickey announced he had found it! So quickly? Yes he did! It's like he channeled the cache owner's knowledge. No matter...we signed the log, happy to have avenged the DNF we had earlier.

We noticed the cache was about 60-65 feet away from where ground zero was, so we took a new set of coordinates. They may not be exact, but they will bring you a lot closer to where  the cache will be.

Thanks for the fun cache! TNLN/SL TFTC!

Parking not far from the exit to the Christmas light show, I gathered my gear and began walking to the coordinates for this listing.  The trail kept a steady and straight course; however, my anxiousness won out.  The GPS was followed dutifully across a small hill and back to the aforementioned pathway.  There, I entered the woods and soon arrived at the coordinates.

Brush was pushed aside as an area with several likely spots was partially illuminated by my flashlight.  Considerable time was spent poking, prodding and gently moving around bits of debris.  Finally, a sneaky idea came to mind, and the GPS was ignored entirely.  Almost immediately the cache was discovered some distance away.  Huzzah!  After signing my name to the log, I continued on my trek around the park.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I was sitting at home doing not much of anything, when all of a sudden my email pinged. New cache! I hurriedly looked to see where it was, and wouldn't you know it? It was in the place I was in very recently...Moberly! Well, not long after, my email pinged again. Another in Moberly! It pinged again...and again...and AGAIN! All told, I saw eight caches pop up!

There was no way I was going to let them slide, so I messaged dphickey and asked him if he wanted to go on an epic FTF run with me. At first he said he couldn't go. I knew I was going anyway, so I told him I'd check as I got closer to Columbia. Sure enough, when I got close to town, he said he was able and ready to go! I picked him up and we took off north to Moberly!

This was the fifth cache of the evening. We arrived at the location for this cache and began the search. We searched and we searched. We consulted the hint and that didn't do us much good, since the hint was kind of vague, given the area. After a while, we decided to leave this one to go to the next.

Again the GPSr would not settle and when it did it was not quite near any one spot.  Lot's of hiding places here and finding a micro in the dark.... well just wasn't in our cards tonight.  Searched high and low, in nooks and crannies but little sis was not having any of it for us tonight.  Can't find them all they say but I am guessing I will try again when the sun is up.

   <groundspeak:short_description html="True">You will find this cache just over the train tracks. There is a small train for kids that runs on Sundays during the summer Schedule is on the parks web site if your interested. Depending on your path you take to this cache you should be able to park close enough to the cache and walk a short distance.</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This cache is part of the Peanuts Gang series in Rothwell Park and Lion's Beuth park. I have chosen the area because there is many areas you can park and still get to more than one cache by walking and then can get back into your vehicle and park again to get the next set of caches. You can also if you want walk or bike the nice trails in the area to get to most of the caches. There are also many things to do in the park, plan to bring the family and stay for more enjoyment after your cache adventure that will take you to many areas of the park including around the lake which will give you good views. If you do bring your kids please watch them when around vehicle used areas and the lake caches are not next to the water and you will have several feet if they get away from you. Most to all the cache should not take long to find depending on your expertise.V1p3rx and I have worked to make the series fun and not finding the same old thing over and over. You will find a couple different styles of hides and also one that is maybe not be the expected way to retrieve the cache from the rest of the series. Stealth may be required due to being close to trails, or areas people may visit. We have attempted to give you geocover in all areas but it is a park. Please make sure the cache is hidden well when you place it back into its hiding spot. There is a archery range in the area so use caution even though caches are not placed in the area of the archery. Hope you enjoy the area and caches available in the park and this series.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charles (Sparky) Monroe Schulz was born on November 22nd, 1922 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, but grow up in St. Paul Minnesota at the age of 77 he passed away on February 12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 2000 in Santa Rosa, California. Schulz first comic strip was called &lt;em&gt;Li’l Folks and ran from June 1947-January 1950 in the&lt;/em&gt; St. Paul Pioneer Press. In Li’l Folks was the first time Schulz used the name Charlie Brown and he created a dog that also looked much like Snoopy. In May of 1948 Schulz sold the first of his one panel drawing to The Saturday Evening Post. After his Li’l Folks comic strip was dropped in the 1950’s, Schulz went to United Feature Syndicated with the one panel Li’I Folks. Interested in his one panel comic, However Schulz had developed a normal four panel strip and at that time and United Feature Syndicated became interested and decided to publish a four panel comic. Peanuts made its debut on October 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt;, 1950, in seven different newspapers. The popular weekly Sunday page made its first appearance on January 6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 1952. When the Peanuts comic strip was on top, it was published every day in 2,600 papers in 75 countries, 21 languages. In almost 50 years the Peanuts comic strip was produced Schulz drew nearly 18,000 strips. Between the comic strips, merchandise, product endorsement produced revenues of more than 1 billion per year. Schulz’s estimated earrings was 30-40 million annually. The Peanuts comic strip only once why Schulz was alive have reshowings when Schulz went on vacation for five-weeks to celebrate his 75&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; birthday. Schulz never had assistants creating the strip and refused to hire an inker or letterer. On December 14&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; 1999 Schulz announced his retirement due to having several small strokes and a blocked aorta. It was later discovered he had colon cancer that had metastasized. Once Schulz started chemotherapy he was unable to see clearly. Schulz on February 12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 2000 died in his sleep around 9:45 P.M. from colon cancer. The last original Peanuts comic strip was produced the next day on Sunday, February 13&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;. Charles Monroe Schulz is buried in Pleasant Hill Cemetery in Sebastopol, California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Franklin Armstrong Was introduced July 31&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;, 1968 as the first black charter in the comic strip. His last appearance was November 5&lt;sup&gt;th,&lt;/sup&gt; 1999 until he appeared in The Peanuts Movie on November 6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 2015. He went to school with Peppermint Patty and Marcie in his first story, Charlie Brown and Franklin meet on the beach. His father was a solder in the Vietnam War.  Franklin was introduced to the peanuts gang when a Los Angeles school teacher named Harriet Glickman wrote Schultz in the spring of 1968 asking him to bring a black character to the comic strip. His last name is consider a apocryphal because the only time his last name is talked about is in the T.V. special you’re in the Super Bowl, Charlie Brown. He is only referred as Franklin in the Comic Strip and other T.V. specials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Geocaching please respect and follow the rules of the park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Park is open to the public daily from 5:00 a.m.-11:00 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not damage any of the parks property, tress, or other wildlife.&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Another FTF run.   All week I've been checking the new Peanuts cache in Moberly to see if anyone found it.  All week it sat.  Amazing.   So today, with nothing better to do, I decided to run to Moberly and find all the caches I have not found yet in the series and not in the series.  Then Arthur and Trillian texted me and I filled him in on my plans.   We modified our plans for him to join me and grab the caches he needed.    We decided to go after the FTF first.  We made our way up 63 then to the park.   We parked in a familiar area only this time in daylight.   We quickly made our way across the railroad and into the woods.   A&amp;T spotted the cache and after a breif wait for the retreival we had a fresh virgin log.   CO-FTF for us.   After signing in we moved on to the next cache to revenge a DNF.

I was sitting at home doing not much of anything, chatting with dphickey about this and that, when he mentioned that he was thinking about a caching run up to Moberly. He wanted to avenge some DNF's, find some new caches and go for a FTF! Well, we teamed up to go accomplish these very goals. I needed a couple he had and he needed a couple I had, so with mutual goals, we set off!

We decided to go for the FTF attempt first, so this is the one we attacked. We parked in a very similar spot where we got another FTF a week or so ago, and took off toward the cache. The walk was nice and easy and in no time we were at ground zero. Cache was in hand very quickly, and we were delighted to find a blank log! We happily scribbled out FTF initials, put everything back as it was, and took off toward the next cache.

Thanks for the fun cache! TNLN/SL TFTC!

   <groundspeak:short_description html="True">When going for this cache depending if we have had precipitation it could be very muddy. Should be able to stay to the edge without getting in the mud. It also in the summer could be some bush wacking to get to the cache. This is a neat area and saw several animals and signs of them when hiding it. Please respect the campers areas when you start your search for this cache</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This cache is part of the Peanuts Gang series in Rothwell Park and Lion's Beuth park. I have chosen the area because there is many areas you can park and still get to more than one cache by walking and then can get back into your vehicle and park again to get the next set of caches. You can also if you want walk or bike the nice trails in the area to get to most of the caches. There are also many things to do in the park, plan to bring the family and stay for more enjoyment after your cache adventure that will take you to many areas of the park including around the lake which will give you good views. If you do bring your kids please watch them when around vehicle used areas and the lake caches are not next to the water and you will have several feet if they get away from you. Most to all the cache should not take long to find depending on your expertise.V1p3rx and I have worked to make the series fun and not finding the same old thing over and over. You will find a couple different styles of hides and also one that is maybe not be the expected way to retrieve the cache from the rest of the series. Stealth may be required due to being close to trails, or areas people may visit. We have attempted to give you geocover in all areas but it is a park. Please make sure the cache is hidden well when you place it back into its hiding spot. There is a archery range in the area so use caution even though caches are not placed in the area of the archery. Hope you enjoy the area and caches available in the park and this series.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charles (Sparky) Monroe Schulz was born on November 22nd, 1922 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, but grow up in St. Paul Minnesota at the age of 77 he passed away on February 12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 2000 in Santa Rosa, California. Schulz first comic strip was called &lt;em&gt;Li’l Folks and ran from June 1947-January 1950 in the&lt;/em&gt; St. Paul Pioneer Press. In Li’l Folks was the first time Schulz used the name Charlie Brown and he created a dog that also looked much like Snoopy. In May of 1948 Schulz sold the first of his one panel drawing to The Saturday Evening Post. After his Li’l Folks comic strip was dropped in the 1950’s, Schulz went to United Feature Syndicated with the one panel Li’I Folks. Interested in his one panel comic, However Schulz had developed a normal four panel strip and at that time and United Feature Syndicated became interested and decided to publish a four panel comic. Peanuts made its debut on October 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt;, 1950, in seven different newspapers. The popular weekly Sunday page made its first appearance on January 6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 1952. When the Peanuts comic strip was on top, it was published every day in 2,600 papers in 75 countries, 21 languages. In almost 50 years the Peanuts comic strip was produced Schulz drew nearly 18,000 strips. Between the comic strips, merchandise, product endorsement produced revenues of more than 1 billion per year. Schulz’s estimated earrings was 30-40 million annually. The Peanuts comic strip only once why Schulz was alive have reshowings when Schulz went on vacation for five-weeks to celebrate his 75&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; birthday. Schulz never had assistants creating the strip and refused to hire an inker or letterer. On December 14&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; 1999 Schulz announced his retirement due to having several small strokes and a blocked aorta. It was later discovered he had colon cancer that had metastasized. Once Schulz started chemotherapy he was unable to see clearly. Schulz on February 12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 2000 died in his sleep around 9:45 P.M. from colon cancer. The last original Peanuts comic strip was produced the next day on Sunday, February 13&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;. Charles Monroe Schulz is buried in Pleasant Hill Cemetery in Sebastopol, California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schroeder-Made his first appearance in comic strips in May 30&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 1951. On that date he was introduced as a baby. The last appearance was made September 12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 1999 in comic stipes. In 1954 Schroeder birthday was revealed as January 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;. Schroeder is known for being one of Charlie Browns best finds and having Lucy Van Pelt leaning on his Piano as he plays. The Piano idea came from Schulz daughter Meredith's toy Piano and that is when Schroeder was born. The first appearance for the piano was on September 24, 1951.Schroeder’s home address was 1770 James Street because 1770 was the year Beethoven was born. The origin of Schroeder’s name came from Schulz's 1975 book called &lt;em&gt;Peanuts Jubilee&lt;/em&gt;: "Schroeder was named after a young boy Charles Schulz used to caddy for at Highland Park golf course in St. Paul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Park is open to the public daily from 5:00 a.m.-11:00 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;

I was sitting at home doing not much of anything, when all of a sudden my email pinged. New cache! I hurriedly looked to see where it was, and wouldn't you know it? It was in the place I was in very recently...Moberly! Well, not long after, my email pinged again. Another in Moberly! It pinged again...and again...and AGAIN! All told, I saw eight caches pop up!

There was no way I was going to let them slide, so I messaged dphickey and asked him if he wanted to go on an epic FTF run with me. At first he said he couldn't go. I knew I was going anyway, so I told him I'd check as I got closer to Columbia. Sure enough, when I got close to town, he said he was able and ready to go! I picked him up and we took off north to Moberly!

This was the eighth and final cache of the evening. We arrived at the best location I could find to park and set off into the woods. We walked to and fro and about halfway into the trip, the batteries on my GPSr died! Oh well...here comes the phone! Not my favorite way, but you gotta do what you gotta do. Anyway, we made the journey just fine and found the final pristine log.

FTF-6 DNF-2

Thanks for the fun cache! TNLN/SL TFTC!

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">This was the final of the Peanuts caches that we found tonight.  We parked .21 miles from the cache and made our way to GZ via an access road new the children's train tracks. Then things got tougher as the road veered off and we bushwhacked into the woods at around  .1 mile from the cache.   The closer we got the more I ran into sticker bushes and low hanging branches....   I don't recommend being crazy like some certain cachers who did this at night.   But it's December and I didn't run into any spider webs or pick up any ticks and we were geocaching... so all was good.   Once we got withing 20 feet we saw what we thought would be the spot and sure enough there was stoic piano player with the clean log that we got to put the first signatures on.   All in all a great series and I will definitely return for the 2 DNFS and the 2 or 3 of the other caches in the series that were published earlier.  TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

Was in the area with Cribbage Witch - On our frequent route from St. Louis to St Joseph Area and back through KC to visit with the Folks in Maysville and the kids in KC.  We decided to pick up a few caches to give ourselves time to stretch.    Even though the trip was about double the length, Geocaching seemed to make it feel it went twice as fast.    Thanks for putting these out to make our trip more enjoyable today.</groundspeak:text>

The wife wanted to make a trip to the Central Christian College of the Bible Book Store today, so that made for a good time to pick up a few caches in the Moberly area.

Was in the area with Cribbage Witch - On our frequent route from St. Louis to St Joseph Area and back through KC to visit with the Folks in Maysville and the kids in KC.  We decided to pick up a few caches to give ourselves time to stretch.    Even though the trip was about double the length, Geocaching seemed to make it feel it went twice as fast.    Thanks for putting these out to make our trip more enjoyable today.</groundspeak:text>

We crossed the road, and each chose the path we thought would be the least muddy. It seemed that there ustabe trains through here and I wondered whether the tracks had been built next to the road or if the road had been paved next to the tracks.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I guess I get the FTSTNL (First To Sign The New Log) award.  We were on a run to the Central Christian College of the Bible Book Store today, so that made for a good time to pick up a few caches in the Moberly area.  The wife was finishing up her Christmas list.   Good use of the description and the hints.  We were able to make the grab and get log signed.  TFTC.

City of Maple 1 A.C.E.&lt;br /&gt;
The City of Maples series The town of Macon was first settled by James T. Haley in 1852. However, long before Mr. Haley's arrival, scores of immigrants from Kentucky and Virginia ventured into the region as early as 1829. In 1872, John Beaumont donated 10,000 young maple trees Because of these 10,000 trees, Macon has been named "The City of Maples". The city have seven beautiful and well maintained parks and lakes.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;series 1 of 10 caches. will be in the city parks or around the lakes., around long branch lakes. and some somewhere in the city.   .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
City of Maple 1 A.C.E.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;George Washington appointed the first engineer officers of the Army on June 16, 1775. Long Branch Dam was authorized by Congress in 1965 as a multi-purpose project for water supply, flood control, recreation, downstream water quality and fish/wildlife management. Construction began in 1973 and the dam was placed into operation in 1980. Thank to the rangers for your approval placing this cache&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Stopped for a quick cache. This looks like a very nice park. Wished I could have stayed to hike some of the trails.

Day 2 of a cross-county trip from Somerset, KY to Denver, CO for a work event. Added an extra day to my travels so I could pick up caches along the way, specifically targeting virtual caches, new states, and a few caches that seemed interesting (making my trek a mini-vacation). Started today in Hannibal, MO and ended in Fairbury, NE. Absolutely loved driving through the miles of agricultural land, free of congestion and noise.</groundspeak:text>

Geese called out overhead as they flew by.  Atomic Goat's Breath and I admired them briefly before seeing to the matter at hand.  We had a geocache to find, and our initial ideas were not bearing fruit.  Goat soon pointed out the container, and I simply had to shake my head in dismay.  How had I overlooked this one?  With a sign of the log, we were back on the road.</groundspeak:text>

Weather prediction was sunny and 50's for the day after Christmas.  I had not been out for a major cache run since July so I got permission from the muggle wife and our adventure was set.  We left before dawn and the plan was to return after sunset.  This was cache 16 for the day.  Signed log team TAD. TFTC.</groundspeak:text>

I am not gonna lie...we had a lot of fun, toured the northern reaches of our area and found some great caches. This is why I like caching...spending time with people, sharing common interests and a sense of adventure! What an awesome way to spend some time with awesome folks!

This cache was signed as TAD for our group. TNLN/SL Thanks, %OwnerName, for placing this cache and for the fun!

Was in the area with Cribbage Witch - On our frequent route from St. Louis to St Joseph Area and back through KC to visit with the Folks in Maysville and the kids in KC.  We decided to pick up a few caches to give ourselves time to stretch.    Even though the trip was about double the length, Geocaching seemed to make it feel it went twice as fast.    Thanks for putting these out to make our trip more enjoyable today.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I had a great time on a road trip with Joe Friday and SWAG Dragon.  We left Thursday morning at 4:15 from Colorado and arrived at the hotel in St. Lewis MO 20 hours later.  Caching along the way always seams to make the time go by faster, but also adds 6 hours to the trip.  
We only found 100 caches total including all the events.  Every one of the caches was special for some reason.  I picked up 35+ new counties, several virtuals, larges, Earth caches, letterboxes, and a couple wherigos we even found about 50 waymarks, some benchmarks and some labs caches.  Some highlights of the trip were seeing the arch, seeing a flash mob broken up by police, SWAG Dragon falling flat into a ditch full of stinky water, being at our first Geowoodstock, and exploring some of the rich local history.  I enjoyed seeing some fellow Colorado cachers 1000 miles away.  The answers for the VCs, and ECs are being sent by Joe Friday, OneKindWord or Egnix.  Let me know if I need to sort through the pics and notes and answer myself. We used a group stamp most of the time. Thank you for placing this cache and keeping it going.  I am glad it was a part of the overall experience of going on a road trip to Geowoodstock.</groundspeak:text>

Failed! backtracked and came in as intended the first time. Badly needs a new container. Our thanks to twilight rabbit.</groundspeak:text>

Cribbage witch mentioned that the container I  found appeared to be the original, Although I don't think it was in the correct spot and it was a REACH to get it.  Where I think was supposed to be - was filled with ants.

Was in the area with Cribbage Witch - On our frequent route from St. Louis to St Joseph Area and back through KC to visit with the Folks in Maysville and the kids in KC.  We decided to pick up a few caches to give ourselves time to stretch.    Even though the trip was about double the length, Geocaching seemed to make it feel it went twice as fast.    Thanks for putting these out to make our trip more enjoyable today.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Cooley1103 found a wasp at GZ and encouraged him away for a bit. This should have been easy, and we located the container, but it seemed just out of reach. I'm sure it wasn't intentional, or maybe that super wasp was responsible, but the magnet was actually stuck to the i-beam inside the black bumper! That's a really strong magnet! We tried using the Nuvi's cable to lasso it...then I used my pen...then I used my hand (hoping no wasps were inside) and was able to flip it and pull it to daylight. For a log that was replaced 5 months ago, it's dry and crisp! Thanks for the challenge! We replaced it in it's likely intended location!</groundspeak:text>

Was in the area with Cribbage Witch - On our frequent route from St. Louis to St Joseph Area and back through KC to visit with the Folks in Maysville and the kids in KC.  We decided to pick up a few caches to give ourselves time to stretch.    Even though the trip was about double the length, Geocaching seemed to make it feel it went twice as fast.    Thanks for putting these out to make our trip more enjoyable today.</groundspeak:text>

County: Macon, Missouri
Delorme Grid: MO-023

Day 2 of my Midwest Journey to Geowoodstock XII from Des Moines, IA.  Today I started in Ottumwa, IA with some foggy weather and got into some rather stormy conditions as I made my way into Missouri.  Eventually I punched through a line of thunderstorms while moving west from Edina to Kirksville.  The rest of the day was quite delightful and the weather kept getting better and better before ending in Columbia, MO.  Most of my good friends going to GWS were well on their way to the event and I had hoped to see some on the journey, but I wound up not crossing paths with anyone though I evidently crossed paths with some of my Maryland friends near Macon or Moberly today.  Lots of fun caches to be had today!

Quick little highway stop on my way from Marceline to Colombia.  TFTC.</groundspeak:text>

Was in the area with Cribbage Witch - On our frequent route from St. Louis to St Joseph Area and back through KC to visit with the Folks in Maysville and the kids in KC.  We decided to pick up a few caches to give ourselves time to stretch.    Even though the trip was about double the length, Geocaching seemed to make it feel it went twice as fast.    Thanks for putting these out to make our trip more enjoyable today.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Antique-nana decided that since I was off work for 2 weeks on shutdown that we should go for a drive &amp; pick up a few new caches &amp; maybe a county or two. I agreed thinking that I could do a few things around the house later in the week &amp; maybe have a couple days just for me the 2nd week. This was last Tuesday (7/8/14)! Little did I know that the counties she wanted to pick up were in Montana, South Dakota, Nebraska, Wyoming Colorado &amp; Kansas. So much for a short day trip &amp; getting a few things done around the house or a few days just for me! Ok, so it was really mostly my idea &amp; she just agreed to tag along as long as I let her try to find all the caches she possibly could !Here's how it really went:I am off work &amp; thought that since neither of us had ever been to North &amp; South Dakota or Montana and she had never been to most of the other states out this way it would be fun to go caching out here. We left last Tuesday &amp; are having a blast going places we have never been, seeing historic places &amp; just places that are different &amp; unusual. To make it even better we are finding all kinds of caches, meeting (unexpectedly) other cachers, trading bugs out, meeting &amp; talking to people we have never met &amp; will probably never meet again. This is what life is all about. I can hardly wait until I retire in another year or so. TN LN SL Thanks so much for making this trip fun with the cache you hid just for us to find!</groundspeak:text>

We were a little leary at first of going past the gate so we read the cache page and saw that we had the okay, WOW! We are so glad we made this cache a stop. Really enjoyed the cemetery, the stones and ornaments around them and took several pics. We have never seen a medal of honor on a monument before and this one was from the Civil War, very cool.  Loved that huge old, unfortunately dead tree.  So glad we stopped in to break up the highway monotony, we really enjoyed this one. Thanks for placing quest4adventure. Getting a favorite from us.

County: Macon, Missouri
Delorme Grid: MO-023

Day 2 of my Midwest Journey to Geowoodstock XII from Des Moines, IA.  Today I started in Ottumwa, IA with some foggy weather and got into some rather stormy conditions as I made my way into Missouri.  Eventually I punched through a line of thunderstorms while moving west from Edina to Kirksville.  The rest of the day was quite delightful and the weather kept getting better and better before ending in Columbia, MO.  Most of my good friends going to GWS were well on their way to the event and I had hoped to see some on the journey, but I wound up not crossing paths with anyone though I evidently crossed paths with some of my Maryland friends near Macon or Moberly today.  Lots of fun caches to be had today!

I wasn't sure of the path to the cache at first, thinking it was private property.  But I took a chance and it led me right back to Martha and the cache.  A large bird lost a significant battle along the pathway by the barn, and most of its carcass was right there and feathers were all over the path for a span of about 150 feet.

Took a moment to spot the cache, but it was in great shape!  TFTC.</groundspeak:text>

I initially had to deal with some rain, but it all cleared up very quickly by the time I got to my first cache. I got a lot of caches today, to say the very least. No matter how many I got today, I had an awesome time just being outdoors and enjoying the weather. This was one of the ones I found, and it helped to create a great experience.

This cache was the 1st of 113 total caches on the day. TNLN/SL Thanks, quest4adventure, for placing this cache and for the fun!

Atomic Goat's Breath and I approached the parking coordinates and decided to chance driving closer.  Goat deftly hopped out of the car and opened the gate for our passage.  It was a bumpy ride to be sure but not enough to deter us.  Once close to the area, we disembarked and carefully sought what we were after.  The find was quick as was the recording of our visit.  Thanks for pointing out this small patch of local history!  After a few photos, we returned from whence we came.

Making my way across the state today picking up caches representing new counties and DeLorme pages for the challenges. Had the option to pick up a few that were a little closer to my main route but couldn't resist swinging a little bit out of the way to get a cache that qualified for the lonely challenge. Didn't have any problems finding the cache but there were a few ants guarding the container. Only took a couple of swipes to get rid of them and it was time to sign the log. Made quick work of replacing the container and getting back on the road again. TNLNSL. Thanks for the cache!</groundspeak:text>

I never could figure out your reference to a "town"???  and MODOT having to replace signs because of the name of the town??   Where's the town?

Having passed up this cache over the years for varying reasons, this day proved to be the one for a visit!  Atomic Goat's Breath and I drove straight from Ten Mile in the hopes that this older hide would still be in good shape.  Parking was easy to find, and, after a brief stroll through the grass, the container was ours.  Nice hiding spot!  Given its age, the geocache was found to be in good shape.  A quick sign to the log saw our return to the car and eventual return to highway 36.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">wrenberlin and I made the trek to Iowa for another state badge as neither of us had that state. Rainy drive there, snowy drive back. I have family ties to Ottumwa so we concentrated our caches in the area for the most part. After having lunch, caching, visiting grandparents and all around enjoying ourselves, it was time to head back ... in a snow storm ... in the dark ... going 30 MPH on the highway. Needless to say we stopped for the night in Kirksville, MO and decided to local cache in the snow and it turned out to be very fun!

this one required hiking through the snow and getting cold feet! The GPS was bouncing us due to the weather but wrenberlin had the cache in short order ... TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">November Ghost and myself + the geo-pibble decided this Saturday was a good day to find a cache in the great state of Iowa. Yes, that would be the same day a snowstorm was predicted to blow through. Despite logic, our adventurous streak prevailed, and we left from Columbia, MO, early in the day to visit Ottumwa, IA, where November Ghost has family roots. Ottumwa is quite charming! I learned how delicious a canteen lunch is while overhearing the locals discussing the brewing snow. Still un-phased by the talk of ferocious flurries, we spent the afternoon finding many fine caches. Our trip included a visit to Ghost’s past and a test of courage involving climbing up the slippery branches of a tree in the rain. You bet we exchanged some high fives after tackling that one. Around 5 or 6, it finally dawned on us that there was supposed to be some inclement weather on the way. Still, we dilly-dallied at a diner before finally getting out on the road as the sun was setting. Did I mention that I’m from the south, and that I’d never driven through snow before? November Ghost was behind the wheel… but that doesn’t mean he could actually see the road. And neither could I. I don’t think I’ve ever been that terrified due to weather. Now I know what those bumps on the sides of the lane are for! Driving blind proved to be much too stressful, so we stopped in Kirksville, MO for the night (and I found my first cache in the snow!) We made it home safe and sound on Sunday morning, and with a hearty respect for Mother Nature. Many thanks to all of the cachers who placed the hides we found on our trip!

Sunday morning, I woke up to a lovely blanket of snow and took the geo-pibble for a walk in it. Turns out, she loves snow! After a morning meetup at the golden arches for coffee, November Ghost and I took the jeep out to make some fresh tracks through the field of white. Finding this cache took a few, but with frozen hands we signed the log. Thanks!</groundspeak:text>

Well, this certainly was new.  Atomic Goat's Breath parked nearby, and the structure was investigated as it was not present during my previous visits.  A bit of walking around left the two of us puzzled.  Fortunately, the cache container was spotted not long thereafter.

This day seemed replete with recent memories.  Both Atomic Goat's Breath and I had visited the train viewing platform at different times in the past; our return ensured that a new cache would be found.  [;)]  Another visitor stayed in his truck and didn't seem to pay mind to our searching around the area.  Ideas on hiding places were tossed back and forth (one with a certain wry humor), and the cache was discovered in good shape.  We returned to the car just in time as a trio of new arrivals soon set upon their own explorations.

Took nothing, left nothing.</groundspeak:text>

Weather prediction was sunny and 50's for the day after Christmas.  I had not been out for a major cache run since July so I got permission from the muggle wife and our adventure was set.  We left before dawn and the plan was to return after sunset.  This was cache 22 for the day.  
  I was at this spot previously for a cache back in 2011 when I made the trip to MOGA.   I guess A&amp;T DNFd that cache on that same day but he was able to find this cache today.   Coords were off about 20 feet to towards the latrines...  All three of our GPSr zeroed out there.   Signed log team TAD. TFTC.</groundspeak:text>

This cache really lived up to it's name. It took us quite a while to find. GZ led us between the gas tank and the womens' outhouse. The cache was about 20 or 30 feet away. It wasn't enough just to search for the cache. We had to walk around and enjoy the sights. A trains horn blew in the distance, but after waiting a while we gave up on seeing it and moved on, but the train was down the line. TFTC

Now I only have 5 to go, but they will have to wait.  Also, filled a couple more dates on the calendar and added a few more counties in north central Missouri to the map.  Drove over 700 miles through rain, snow and sun, but it was all worth it for the joy of more smilies!  Thanks to all the CO’s for creating and maintaining these hides for my enjoyment, especially the old ones!  Cache on!

Another quick find, another MO county.  Thanks!!</groundspeak:text>

ScrapLadyS needed a ride-along buddy to go see her son pitch some college baseball, so what better than to make it a georoad trip?  We planned a few dozen caches, but time and distance prevented us from doing all of them.  No worries.  Better to have too many than too few.  This cache was one that we picked up during the weekend.  Thank you for placing it!

Some of these may be logged out of order due to some weird happening with the app.  They aren't in order there.  O.o</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">wrenberlin and I made the trek to Iowa for another state badge as neither of us had that state. Rainy drive there, snowy drive back. I have family ties to Ottumwa so we concentrated our caches in the area for the most part. After having lunch, caching, visiting grandparents and all around enjoying ourselves, it was time to head back ... in a snow storm ... in the dark ... going 30 MPH on the highway. Needless to say we stopped for the night in Kirksville, MO and decided to local cache in the snow and it turned out to be very fun!

perfect for a snowy and cold day! TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">November Ghost and myself + the geo-pibble decided this Saturday was a good day to find a cache in the great state of Iowa. Yes, that would be the same day a snowstorm was predicted to blow through. Despite logic, our adventurous streak prevailed, and we left from Columbia, MO, early in the day to visit Ottumwa, IA, where November Ghost has family roots. Ottumwa is quite charming! I learned how delicious a canteen lunch is while overhearing the locals discussing the brewing snow. Still un-phased by the talk of ferocious flurries, we spent the afternoon finding many fine caches. Our trip included a visit to Ghost’s past and a test of courage involving climbing up the slippery branches of a tree in the rain. You bet we exchanged some high fives after tackling that one. Around 5 or 6, it finally dawned on us that there was supposed to be some inclement weather on the way. Still, we dilly-dallied at a diner before finally getting out on the road as the sun was setting. Did I mention that I’m from the south, and that I’d never driven through snow before? November Ghost was behind the wheel… but that doesn’t mean he could actually see the road. And neither could I. I don’t think I’ve ever been that terrified due to weather. Now I know what those bumps on the sides of the lane are for! Driving blind proved to be much too stressful, so we stopped in Kirksville, MO for the night (and I found my first cache in the snow!) We made it home safe and sound on Sunday morning, and with a hearty respect for Mother Nature. Many thanks to all of the cachers who placed the hides we found on our trip!

Sunday morning, I woke up to a lovely blanket of snow and took the geo-pibble for a walk in it. Turns out, she loves snow! After a morning meetup at the golden arches for coffee, November Ghost and I took the jeep out to make some fresh tracks through the field of white. This park-n-grab was a fun find today. Thanks!</groundspeak:text>

We came there to watch the grandson's team play a baseball tourney at Champions Village in Bellevue. Spending a couple days at Shoemaker's RV Park in Bevier, MO waiting for storms to move on east. Decided to pick up a few caches today while it is not raining, though pretty cool for July 3rd. Cache is in good shape. T-TB L-TB SL Thanks for having this available.

Has a nice visit with CO &amp; friend. Cool store to check out when here.</groundspeak:text>

Was in the area with Cribbage Witch - On our frequent route from St. Louis to St Joseph Area and back through KC to visit with the Folks in Maysville and the kids in KC.  This time we didnt do the KC leg but instead headed back across the state using 36 to Hannibal and down.  We decided to pick up a few caches to give ourselves time to stretch. Even though the trip was about double the length, Geocaching seemed to make it feel it went twice as fast. This was one we found on the return trip...Thanks for putting these out to make our trip more enjoyable today.</groundspeak:text>

Setting sights north, Atomic Goat's Breath and I had a decision to make once in Macon:  east or west?  East was chosen as the route would loop nicely around to other caches we intended to attempt.  Before long, we were in Ten Mile and nimbly seeking the hidden container.  Goat made the find and shared the log.  Once back in place, we returned to the road and further adventures to the west!

Took nothing, left nothing.</groundspeak:text>

I was just here on a short trip from Houston and unable to get away from visiting relatives at that time of the day.  Brought back memories seeing an old general store like this.  There was one in Cherry Box near where I grew up as well.

Picked up a geocoin to take with me back to Texas.  Will place it in a new cache soon.

   <groundspeak:short_description html="False">The 9th installment in the Boys of Summer Series revolves around Bob "Riverboat" Smith.  Riverboat only played 2 years in the big leagues, but in 1958 he pitched in 17 games for the Boston Red Sox with a record of 4-3.  A man by the name of Ted Williams played on that team also, some of you may have heard of him.  I also had the pleasure of talking to one of Riverboat's childhood friends that said he had never seen anyone with better stuff than Riverboat.</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Waypoint #1 will take you to the final resting place of Riverboat Smith.  At this location you will need the following information.  
What year was the Union Church established?    ABCD

The final cache is a very small nano about the size of a fingernail.  It is located at:   N   39.44.8BC
                                        W 092.15.A8B

This are may take a great deal of stealth during the summer months of an evening.  Please bring your own pencil for logging.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">What a pleasant surprise to see a 3 M&amp;M Boys of Summer cache as we were Geocaching west of Shelbina in the Macon/Moberly area.
We arrived at Bob's resting place using the last remnants of daylight to view his headstone. 
By the time I arrived at the final coordinates I was in full-on night vision mode. I used my flashlight only long enough to put pen to paper. Buzz Kill asked where I went as she couldn't see me once I closed the door of my truck. 
Plus, it's been over 15 months since the last find. 
Thanks again for the great series!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Found Riverboat's grave and got the numerals for the second coordinates.  That location made complete sense.  There were several potential places for small logs like described, but all of those places were missing what is referenced in the hint.  There was a larger one there, but it didn't budge when I tried so I assumed the nano had gone missing again......  Returned 11/29/14 and found it so missed it the first time.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I’m going to let the CO make the call on this one. I found stage one, but was a little slow finding where to find the answer to the question for the final and then I had a doh moment. On the way to the final, I almost ran a stop sign because I was looking at something near the interstation that would have made it quite ironic if a cop had stopped me. The final made perfect sense, but when I looked to where I was sure the caches was there was no container. So it’s up to the CO if I can log this as a find.

My thanks to the CO.

After paying my respects, I found the required information, inputted the coordinates into the GPS and set off down the road.  For some reason, they lead me a hair over a third of a mile away to the middle of a field.  Geosense was telling me this couldn't be right, so I returned to the Union Church to figure things out.  A-ha!  I had not entered the coordinates correctly.  [:P]  Word to the wise:  Always double check your work.  Once again, I drove down the road to discover the true hiding spot.  It's a fitting place as other geocachers have attested to.  The find was quick, but blimey was it getting cold and gusty out there!  I signed the log as best I could on the spot and returned the container.  Then, after snapping a few photos, I was back in the warm car.  Ahhh!</groundspeak:text>

Visited Bob when I found the church.  He was resting comfortably.  No mention of his baseball career on the stone.
Then moved on to the final.  Appropriate.  Cache was is good shape, but log is pretty full.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Made a slight detour for this one after leaving Macon headed to Shelbina for a day long caching trip.  Found Riverboats resting place.  The info needed was conveniently visible from the coordinates.  After parking under a shade tree by the church, I figured out the new coordinates and then went on my way.  The final coordinates took me to the perfect tribute area for Riverboat Smith.  I went to the coordinates and realized where the cache was once I was within 30 feet.  I confirmed my suspicion but didn't sign the log as groundskeepers were working close by.  You're right.  This would be an impossible find in the evenings.  TFTC.  Great job!!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">So it turned out that this Saturday was to be epic. Around 70º in the middle of February? Heck yes, sign me up! So, discussing this very fact with dphickey, we decided that caching was in order. I know! Let's go to the Mark Twain Lake area! Done deal. We met up and took off to the sparsely inhabited reaches of the area. Along the way, we picked up some caches that I already had but dphickey didn't. We did park and grabs and we did quite a few on an extended hike. The views were awesome and the weather perfect. Thanks for placing this cache, as it added to the day's fun! TNLN/SL TFTC!

After talking with Arthur and Trillian about caching we secured permission from our wives to escape.  The plan, attack the old MOGA caches at Mark Twain Lake.   After making some hasty preperations we were on the road heading north.   This cache was 1 for the day.  As we made our way up 24 Arthur asked if I saw any caches that I had not found to speak up.  This cache and the string of caches up the road immediately showed up.  After debating if the road was a road or driveway we threw caution to the wind and drove up.

We did a lot of hiking and picked off close to 100 ticks only had about 25 that had dug in the first day.  So today we decided to get more of the quick ones around town.  All in all we had a great time grabbing these great caches. Thanks for placing this cache and thanks to the land owners for letting us visit and grab this cache.</groundspeak:text>

County: Monroe, Missouri
Delorme Grid: MO-031

Day 3 of my Midwest Journey to Geowoodstock XII from Des Moines, IA.  Today was the day I finally arrived at GW XII.  I started the journey in Colombia, MO but had a lot of counties to clean up in Missouri before I finally made it to the event location.  Even though it was about 100 miles from Columbia to St. Charles, I think I wound up driving over 300 miles to get a whole bunch of caches up to Hannibal and after zigging and zagging around.  Weather was good most of the day, however the muggle factor was rather intense on the Friday before Memorial Day and law enforcement was everywhere and were extrememly intense!

Almost didn't pull into the driveway when I realized how "private" this area was.  But re-read the cache description and saw everything was okay.  Pulled in around 9:30am in my Black Nissan Senta (rented) and found nobody out and about.  I quickly found the cache and signed it, noting the attachment is not really attached to the container anymore, but it will hold for now.  Looked for the CO to see if they were out and about on the farm but did not see anybody.  Waved at the house on the way out and continued on my journey.

TFTC and sharing the wonderful views from your property.</groundspeak:text>

Weather prediction was sunny and 50's for the day after Christmas.  I had not been out for a major cache run since July so I got permission from the muggle wife and our adventure was set.  We left before dawn and the plan was to return after sunset.  This was cache 41 for the day.  

This cache had a couple inches of water in it.  Next finder if they read this log may bring a dry log book and baggy to help keep this one active.

Unfortunately, that made my hand catch on a thorn nearby, and it took me days to get all the ouchy bits out of my skin. At least I have several pairs of tweezers available!

The cache doesn't have much cover, but is in good shape. I do like an ammo can, even if I don't have swag ready.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">From Southeast Missouri working on the DeLorme challenge. This is our third day out and today we have been trying to stay ahead of the rain.  It has been a fun trip finding great caches and seeing areas of Missouri I have never been to. 
A great big THANK YOU goes out to everyone for placing these caches and bringing me to some areas that are filled with loads of history!! We have had a blast!!  

The rain opened up right after this cache and we were unable to continue on to the rest of this little series, [:(]

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Cache number 9474. Out caching solo today.  This is out of town Tuesday, but Trekto went fishing and Major134 had to work.  I decided to go fishing for caches Trekto already had.  I headed up to Mark Twain Lake and made some grabs.    Thanks for placing this cache.

Weather prediction was sunny and 50's for the day after Christmas.  I had not been out for a major cache run since July so I got permission from the muggle wife and our adventure was set.  We left before dawn and the plan was to return after sunset.  This was cache 43 for the day.  Log was a bit wet but we were able to sign.  Signed log team TAD. TFTC.</groundspeak:text>

I am not gonna lie...we had a lot of fun, toured the northern reaches of our area and found some great caches. This is why I like caching...spending time with people, sharing common interests and a sense of adventure! What an awesome way to spend some time with awesome folks!

This cache was signed as TAD for our group. TNLN/SL Thanks, %OwnerName, for placing this cache and for the fun!

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Got an invite from Arthur of Arthur and Trillian to do a geocache run up 63 and around the northern part of Missouri the other day.   Weather prediction was sunny and 50's for the day after Christmas.  I had not been out for a major cache run since July so I got permission from the muggle wife and our adventure was set.  We left before dawn and the plan was to return after sunset.  This was cache 46 for the day. 
  I did a lot of maintainance on this one.  The strings it was hanging from had been chewed  up and the cache was down inside it's hiding spot.  Tony was able to retreive the log which was outside the cache, and I grabbed the container.  Retying the string as best I could and put the log in a baggie back in cache.  Container has a hole in it.   Not sure what more can be done without a new container.

The container was busted, and the log was outside of the container. We appreciate the hide, and don't want to see it get archived. We put it back with some minor repairs to keep it going.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Fourth cache of the day. Scout and Finance Guy were on our way to Rocheport to ride the Katy Trail today. Decided to detour from the highway to grab a few quick caches and visit the Union Covered Bridge. The road was quiet as we pulled up, but shortly afterwards, we would encounter some traffic. Many thanks.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Cache number 9472. Out caching solo today.  This is out of town Tuesday, but Trekto went fishing and Major134 had to work.  I decided to go fishing for caches Trekto already had.  I headed up to Mark Twain Lake and made some grabs.    Thanks for placing this cache.

Day 3 of my Midwest Journey to Geowoodstock XII from Des Moines, IA.  Today was the day I finally arrived at GW XII.  I started the journey in Colombia, MO but had a lot of counties to clean up in Missouri before I finally made it to the event location.  Even though it was about 100 miles from Columbia to St. Charles, I think I wound up driving over 300 miles to get a whole bunch of caches up to Hannibal and after zigging and zagging around.  Weather was good most of the day, however the muggle factor was rather intense on the Friday before Memorial Day and law enforcement was everywhere and were extrememly intense!

A bit of an adventure to this cache location today.  Many of the roads my Nuvi wanted me to take didn't seem ot actually exist, and those that did seem to be closed for construction.  I eventually spiraled my way in towards the cache's location and was rewarded with a splendid view from a picturesque old bridge of a creek eroding out the bluff.  Took a little bit of searching but found the nicely hidden cache after a brief search.  TFTC.

Since it's a decent drive up there, we left a bit early to take in some fun, and what better way to have fun than to cache? We got to tour the countryside, breathe in the fresh air and just plain enjoy our day. We're glad that this cache could be part of our fun!

This cache was the 3rd of 18 total caches on the day. TNLN/SL Thanks, Atomic Goats Breath, for placing this cache and for the fun!

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">FTF!  Stan Marsh, on South Park, on many episodes says, "You know?  I really learned something today."  Well, so did I.  Since this one hadn't been found yet, and the better half was supposed to be delayed getting home, I decided to head out after work.  I figured I'd get there while it was still light, and all would be good.  

I made it to what my GPSrs were telling me was the cache location, but I knew I was not in the right place, and I was pretty sure I knew what was wrong.  I pulled out my phone, and checked the coordinates (while they are in my GSAK databas, I hadn't yet transferred them to my devices.  I'd manually entered them before I set out.  I stared at the phone.  Is that 25 or 26?  I have no idea.  I pulled up the menu on TomTom, and I had entered 25.  I guess it's 26.  Re-entered the correct number, and continued off down the road (after two 15 point turns).  I approach ground zero, and think that this is it.  I top the hill, and there's a deer hunter at his vehicle, walking around.  Okay.  I can wait him out, which I did.  He left, and I poked in a 26, and set off.  It took a few minutes for the Garmin to settle down, but I found the container fairly quickly, and set about signing the log.  I signed in the first-to-find spot, just above the "NOT first to find," Unitzoid.  Had to sign using a flashlight because daylight had abandoned me.  Just as I was replacing the cache, the coyotes started in a few hundred yards away.  I decided it was time to leave this aptly named cache, and return to my car.  Thank you for placing this one, AGB!</groundspeak:text>

Crossing this bridge, it was evident how beautiful the area was.  Atomic Goat's Breath was inspired and decided he would place a geocache here.  I was allowed to sign the log with the condition that my find would not count as "first-to-find".  Given how often I'm around the area (not much at all), I agreed and happily added my caching monicker.  Good on you for highlighting a really cool spot, Goat!</groundspeak:text>

December has always been an interesting month in Missouri.  Either it's blistering cold or mild depending on which way the wind blows.  Given temperatures in the 60's, I opted to take a day off of work and geocache around the Mark Twain Lake area.  There were a few different routes to choose from . . . where would the journey begin?

Arriving at the coordinates for this cache, I was jazzed and ready to find as many caches as I could!  There were a few decent hiding spots, but, as always, only one turned out to be true.  The log was in fair shape and took my signature; however, a baggie was provided to help keep it safe for the upcoming winter.  Once the container was replaced (and a few photographs taken), I was back on the road to Mark Twain Lake.</groundspeak:text>

Doing my thing last night, I saw this cache publish. It's a bit out of the way for me, so I didn't rush out for it, thinking someone else might get it. 

Well, I woke up this morning to see it was still unfound. Hmmmm. It was not long after that my mom called, wanting me to mow her lawn. What the heck, I figured...let's go for it! 

The drive there was pleasant and in no time I was at ground zero. I quickly had cache in hand and was delighted to see a virgin log sheet! I quickly defiled it with my signature, put everything back and headed on down the road to Mexico. 

Thanks for the new cache jsmtech!
