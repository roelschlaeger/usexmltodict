I spotted this one on the radar and headed for it. When we got near, we got a good parking spot and began our trek to GZ. Once there, we spotted the container in short order. It is always a team effort as we select different areas to search around GZ to get the cache or the information we need, or, will cover for each other and look in areas each other has looked if we don't quickly find it. We extracted the sacred parchment from within, noted our visit thereupon, and returned it to it's place in the container. We then replaced the container as it was found.\nThanks for making a long trip easier to take, even though stopping for caches makes it even longer. At least we got a nice leg stretch out of it as well.  All is well here."

We enjoyed beautiful sunshine for most of the trip but encountered 3 MAJOR thunderstorms.  Wow!

(doesn't look like it has been used here, as this cem needs a lot of tlc). i made the pretty quick find.  the log was mush, so i replaced it in a zippy. this was 1 of many on the day for us. thanks jennings.r for the hide, the exercise we got getting to it, and of course the smiley for me."

In 1862 the county board of supervisors voted to turn the old Ewington courthouse into the county's first Poor House.\u00a0The Effingham County Poor House / Poor Farm stayed at Ewington until the 1890's when the poor farm was moved. \u00a0Tha paupers that lived at the poor farm / poor house were for all instances indentured slaves who had legally sold themselves to the poor farm.\u00a0(See the whole story at\u00a0<a href=\"http://goo.gl/PI9ZeB\" style=\"line-height:20.8px;\">http://goo.gl/PI9ZeB</a>).\u00a0</p>\n<p>The cemetery has many old graves including civil war veterans from both USA and CSA armies and one revolutionary war verteran - Charles Moore (see\u00a0<a href=\"http://goo.gl/jV1a6x\">http://goo.gl/jV1a6x</a>) \u00a0Placing the cache I came across a rarity for this part of the country - a grave with a date in the 1700's - Amos DuHamel was born in 1793 and died 1873. \u00a0The census shows he was living in Effingham in 1870 but since he is buried here I would guess he was one of the 200 residents that packed up and moved house and all down the road to Effingham.</p>"

I also found my first caches in the Missouri counties of St. Louis, St. Charles, Warren, Montgomery, Callaway, Boone, Cooper, Saline, Lafayette, and Jackson. I like to pick up new counties as I have opportunity. A few years ago I completed the Texas County Challenge where I found at least one cache in all 254 Texas counties. Finishing Arizona was easy, and my next states to finish should be New Mexico and Colorado this summer. I love travelling the back roads. I have been in East Lansing, Michigan for a conference. For the summer we are living in Colorado, and I hope to come this way again sometime soon.\n--tamiuron, sign nano logs TRON"

When I get home I will check to see how many counties and DeLorme pages I have added.\n\nThis cache find was my find number twelve (12) for the day and  my overall find number twenty two thousand three hundred one (22301).  This find also extends my consecutive day find streak to three hundred one (301) days, nine (9) months long plus.  Wow!  I never thought that I would get a streak going for so long.\n\nI hope your year 2014 was better for you than your year 2013 turned out to be.  May your year 2015 be an even better year for you than your year 2014 was.  May all of your days bring you more smiles [:)] than frowns [:(].  May all of your problems be as easy to solve as finding 1/1 Lamp Post Caches (LPCs).  [:D]\n\nHappy caching and CACHE ON!"

She was then shipped 80 miles to St. Elmo IL. The original plans were to reconstruct her on \"Water Tower Lake\" which is just off interstate 70 in St. Elmo. The owner had agreements with the city of St. Elmo but the election of a new mayor and city officials shortly after The President arrived saw that agreement change. The owner then moved the boat a second time about 1/2 mile to the parking lot of an abandon business on the other side of the interstate. It was not long after that move that the ship was moved a third time about 24 miles to this location. \u00a0\u00a0She is now about 100 miles away from the river.</p>\n<p>She was built in 1924 and then known as The Cincinnati. She was originally an overnight packet boat which carried passengers and freight from Cincinnati, Ohio, to Louisville, Kentucky. Her first trip was to New Orleans for Mardi Gras.</p>\n<p>In 1929, she was acquired by the Streckfus Company which briefly continued her use as a packet boat but then laid her up, until 1932. Streckfus moved her to her new home port of St. Louis, Missouri. Over the next two years, the ship was converted to become the largest excursion boat in America. The entire superstructure was rebuilt in steel; and a two-deck-high ballroom was added, as well as a bandstand. It was at this time that she received her new name, President.</p>\n<p>Newly converted and newly named, she opened for business in 1934. Streckfus advertised her as \"the New 5 Deck Luxury Super Steamer, Biggest and Finest On The Upper Mississippi\". She continued tramping (having no fixed schedule or published ports of call) until 1941. In 1940, she was displaced from her position as flagship of the Streckfus line by the S.S. Admiral.</p>\n<p>In 1941, she switched her home port to New Orleans. Because fuel oil was restricted and many of the young crewmen joined the armed forces with the nation's entry into World War II, tramping was discontinued, and the cruises stayed close to home. After the war, President remained in New Orleans for many years as a popular music venue, featuring concerts by national acts such as U2, Cyndi Lauper, Men at Work, The Little River Band, and The Producers, and performances by New Orleans artists like Dr. John, The Neville Brothers, and The Cold.</p>\n<p>Because the wind made maneuvering the big boat difficult, she had her two side wheels removed and replaced by 1,000 horsepower (750 kW) diesel engines in 1978.</p>\n<p>She was sold in 1985 and returned to St. Louis as her home port. While there, she was listed on the National Register of Historic Places and designated a National Historic Landmark on Dec. 20, 1989. She was retired from active service in 2000. On July 27, 2011, the Department of the Interior issued a press release that included the following line; \".. The President, a steamboat in St. Elmo, Illinois, had its designation as a National Historic Landmark withdrawn because of a loss of historic integrity.\" The ship was removed from the National Register entirely.</p>\n<p>For more info visit <a href=\"http://steamboats.com/museum/thepresident.html\">The Online Steamship Museum page on The President</a>.</p>\n<p>If you watch the video from the TV Series - Monster Moves:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TSVBIAMSwI&amp;feature=youtu.be\">Monster Moves - The Pride of the Mississippi</a></p>\n<p>you can see her last voyage, see them cut her up and truck her off to St. Elmo. \u00a0Once you get to GZ you will recognize many of the part of the ship from the video. \u00a0The parts are so large they are readily recognizable on <a href=\"http://goo.gl/eCu8oQ\">Google Maps</a>. \u00a0(BTW - this pin is on the wheelhouse for the steamboat - it is NOT on the cache! \u00a0You will NOT need to go this far into the area.) \u00a0When I talked with the owner, Dave Campbell in April of 2015 his plans were to reconstruct the ship with as much original material as possible and make it into an entertainment venue. \u00a0The plans are to put it somewhere near the interstate highways running through Effingham IL.</p>\nThanks to 1954 Gator for the cache container and providing trasport to GZ for the hide!"

I mentioned to the T of the group that there was  cache down the road at the President. Then. Life  A LOT of life happened and this was forgotten.    Today we were taking the long way home from watching the Bugs drive to downtown for the Bug Fest and the T of the group was pointing out to the Grandma of the group that that's  where  the President steamboat lives now.  See...we hail  from SLAGAland. The President was part of our home town for awhile.  Then..it dawned on me - hey there's  a cache there.  A quick couple of U turns and ...  noticed another car pulling in too.  Our first time meeting anyone on the trail here.  Headed out for  the find. The T of the Group went for it while I chatted up the mom of the other group. Newbies! Awesome!  T made the find, I got to chat with strangers and a good time was had by all.  Who do you have to know to make a bid on the hint? We think we need that next to our little dock on our little lake."

I reshot the coords and averaged (10 positions) and came up with the coords N 39\u00b0 08.209 W 088\u00b0 28.801.  The West was dead on but the North was off a bit.  Cache owner may consider updating the coords.  The log was in great shape.  I remember finding a cache near here years ago but that one is now gone.

Although,  since it is TTown and the Friday before Halloween, it actually WAS Halloween.  Dodged a few grade school girls on the way and avoided most Trick or Treaters.  Using phones and took a bit for them to settle.  Had one of those \"are toy serious .... the cache is THERE \" moments and briefly cursed the cache owner. :)   All was well though and didn't take a lot of time to make the find.

[xx(]\n\nWhen I placed this cache I THOUGHT I had an \"official\" log and I did not - so I used any old slip of paper and wanted to place an OFFICIAL log in the cache later.  So along comes Saturday and I find will be in Effingham and I will have 5 minutes or so as the wife wanders around in the grocery store spending my money.  (She is GOOD at that!)  Before I leave home I check the website and find - nobody has found it.  Great!  So I grab an \"official\" log, put it in a new plastic baggie and stash it in my pocket.  I drop off the wife and head to the cache.  The replacement must have looked like a NASCAR \"splash and go\" pit stop.  I slam the car in park - dash to the container - pull the old log - slip in the new one and roar back out.  I rolled up to the store just as the wife is rolling a shopping cart packed with things she loves and I eat if I am hungry enough.  PERFECT! - Or so I think.  In my haste I did not even think about checking the log I just pulled.  I get back home last night and see the emails and pull the old log out of my pocket.\n\nBUSTED!! - there is a signature on it!\n\nI am real sorry for the FTF confusion.  Awanderer is the TRUE FTF for the cache and my apologies for the mixup.  \n\nTKLNHL & Kyd - just to let you know - I have my eyes on a spot on the other side of the county for another cache.  Keep your eyes peeled for it.  Maybe you will get FTF and awanderer will get it second!\n\nAlso - looks like I may need to reshoot the coords?  I took coords and a buddy (1954Gator) took coords and both were bouncing around.  We \"averaged\" the two and figured that would be the best.  Looks like I need to pick a good day and get coords again."

The N in the group wanted to rush out right away for the find when the email came through. But, she was patient and waited for the T and even drug The Kyd along today for the find.  Wanted to wait because had no idea this was here and wanted to share it with the entire little family. We have lived here for about six years and it is safe to say that we have driven by this well over 1000 times and never once looked that direction and thought, \"wow, bet that that's where that drive in used to be.\"  Have heard that there was once a drive in around here and maybe even knew that the sign at Mid America Motorworks was from there. But never once knew that THIS is where it was.  Pretty cool.  Love it when we discover things like this through geocaching.    Now, as for the log.  We were a bit disappointed to set out and see that someone had already logged a find, TODAY.  Bummer. But that's OK, we would suck it up and deal.  HOWEVER, when we got there, found the cache AND the log, it had not been signed. Not sure if we are FTF or not. ?????  That brings me to the next point.  The coordinates appear to be  a bit off.  Even when we looked at the cache on a satellite map, kind of thought, \" hmmmm bet that that's not really where it is.\"  Got there, used a little of geosense and the good hint and found it with no problem at all. \nWe happened to actually have a GPS with us and got the following coordinates N39.07.505 W 088.30.884\nThanks for getting us out of the house for a bit today and providing a bit of local history; really enjoyed the cache page."

I had intended on getting eleven counties today, but I did start later than I wanted to and I had to shave off a couple from my plan.  I had a nice time exploring the countryside.  I was able to visit towns I've never been to before.  I saw a statue of a white squirrel (but sadly, I didn't see any white squirrels), I saw some cute towns, a turtle in the woods by a cemetery, and a band shell/shelter house close to a courthouse -- very throw back.  I was able to dodge the rain that moved across the states today -- it poured in Indianapolis today, but I wasn't there -- I was in Southern Illinois!  \n\nI found a couple of tricky caches, but for the most part the caches were easy ones that I targeted.  It wasn't a very high step count day for me due to all of the driving -- probably drove for over 12 hours today.  Yes, I might have a problem.  It's not a problem for me though...  I had a few DNF's -- one at an old bank in Mill Shoals -- very cool building that isn't used as a bank anymore, and people's houses and trailers are close to it now, strange juxtaposition.\n\nA big thank you to the cache owners for putting out caches for me to go get!  It was late when I got this one -- time to head back!"

Finally packed up the geodog and headed alllllllllll the way to south side of town hoping that even though the day was quickly going by, that I'd still have a FTF . Quickly became apparent I was also racing the end of school and increased traffic.  Got to GZ and thought, \"That's what this was? Cool.  Wondered about this random spot.\" We can now add a bit more information to our lives to make us sound like a local, \"You know down there by Dutch Lane where they used to do the highway striping testing...\".  Dutch Lane must be a thing.  N's BFF's parents live on a Dutch Lane in Brighton.  Sooooo... Made the find.
