The event went off without a hitch and the conditions couldn't have been better. The great weather continued into the afternoon, when it was at this point that I decided to go after these new caches.\n\nI saw one pop up the night before, but I was too pooped to go after it, having already traveled to Marshall, Sedalia, Jeff City and back home. No matter...another cacher got the well-earned FTF. Early this morning, however, I noticed five more caches publish. Hmmm...better get to work on them. I got all but one solved, and that one was quickly rectified after I got a tip from the cache owner. Solving them was all I could do, though, because I had an event to attend.\n\nAfter the event was over and we were heading back home, I noticed that the caches had remained unfound. What the heck, I thought...let's go for them! Best case scenario, I get a few FTF's and cache on a gorgeous day...worst case, I still get to cache on a gorgeous day! So, I loaded up the GPSr and scooted off down the road.\n\nThis cache was the first of the new caches I went after. As I neared the area of ground zero, I kinda had an idea where it might be. I was wrong just a bit. The second place I looked held the container. I opened it up and was pleased to find a blank log, which I dutifully marred in the FTF spot. I put it back and set out for the next one.\n\nThanks for placing this cache for everyone, myself included, to enjoy! TNLN/SL TFTC!\n\nYes, we know where our towels are...\n\n-Fulton, MO"

The event went off without a hitch and the conditions couldn't have been better. The great weather continued into the afternoon, when it was at this point that I decided to go after these new caches.\n\nI saw one pop up the night before, but I was too pooped to go after it, having already traveled to Marshall, Sedalia, Jeff City and back home. No matter...another cacher got the well-earned FTF. Early this morning, however, I noticed five more caches publish. Hmmm...better get to work on them. I got all but one solved, and that one was quickly rectified after I got a tip from the cache owner. Solving them was all I could do, though, because I had an event to attend.\n\nAfter the event was over and we were heading back home, I noticed that the caches had remained unfound. What the heck, I thought...let's go for them! Best case scenario, I get a few FTF's and cache on a gorgeous day...worst case, I still get to cache on a gorgeous day! So, I loaded up the GPSr and scooted off down the road.\n\nThis cache was the second of the new caches I went after. As I drove up, I had a fairly good idea where this one might be. After poking around a minute or two, I found the well-cammoed container. Opening it up, I was greeted by another clean log sheet! I scribbled my name on the FTF spot and put it back and set out for the next one.\n\nThanks for placing this cache for everyone, myself included, to enjoy! TNLN/SL TFTC!\n\nYes, we know where our towels are...\n\n-Fulton, MO"

Maybe it's due to a hard hike, an evil hide, avenging multiple DNF's, or even redeeming actual physical hardship to get to it. I think I can apply most of these examples to this one.\n\nI won't bore you with the saga of my previous attempts, as they are there for the world to see below this log. Suffice it to say, when I saw that the cache had been updated and the final moved a bit, I had a renewed hope for finding this cache. Figuring it'd be a safer spot for me to search based on the maintenance log, I asked Trillian if we could go after it, so we stopped by on the way to our son's tennis match at Battle High School. \n\nI headed to the new spot and began my search. After some looking, I spotted the container. Just in case, I donned a pair of gloves I had in the car (Why didn't I have any in the other vehicle I used the last two times?) and retrieved the container. I opened it up and was happy to see it blank! With a great sense of relief, I signed that FTF spot. I put everything back nicely and then Trillian and I continued our way to Battle.\n\nThank you, spitoony, for the series and most especially your patience with this cache. A favorite point has most certainly been earned. TNLN/SL\n\nYes, we know where our towels are...\n\n-Fulton, MO"

I looked down to see about half a dozen large black ants on me, dutifully defending their turf via bites. \n\nI brushed them off quickly and thought that was that. Heck, I even emailed the cache owner joking about it. Well, it wasn't exactly the end...\n\nNot long after I hit \"send\" on the email, I began to feel odd with a sense of slight dizziness, coughing, a skin reaction near the bites and the kind of breathing you have after ascending a large hill. Something wasn't right. On that note, I packed it up and sped off toward home.\n\nI got home and Dr. Trillian ordered me to take a couple Benadryl. Slowly things started to get better.\n\nI hated to DNF this cache again, but Mother Nature decided it wasn't my time. Dr. Trillian decided I had better go after the cache in the winter, when the bugs would be dormant. That advice I shall follow.\n\nI offer a hearty congratulations in advance for the FTF'er on this cache. I, however, will wait on this one for a while. No matter what, thanks spitoony for the cache"

The barklice and booklice are tiny, ineffectual creatures that humans rarely come in contact with.

Entomologists once considered the true lice to be a separate order from the booklice and barklice. Being incapable of leaving well-enough alone, though, systematists have reclassified the true lice as being evolutionarily descended from other psocodeans, and thus part of the order. What was the name of the order that formerly contained the true lice?<br />\n<div>\n<blockquote>Phtheraptira = 0<br />\nPhthiraptera = 1<br />\nPhtireptira = 2<br />\nPthiraphtera = 3<br /></blockquote>\n</div>\n<div>C. The true lice are obligate parasites of warm-blooded animals. Their hosts include every species of bird and mammal except monotremes, pangolins, bats, and cetaceans. What are monotremes?</div>\n<div>\n<blockquote>Kangaroos and wallabies = 6<br />\n<div>Voles and flying foxes= 5<br />\n<div>Spiny anteaters and the platypus = 0<br />\n<div>Aardvarks and aardwolves= 4<br /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<div>D. The human body louse, <i>Pediculus humanus humanus</i>, vectors the pathogen <i>Rickettsia prowazekii</i> (I love Latin binomials!). The pathogen lives in the louse gut, and is subsequently excreted onto the host, which then scratches the louse bite, thus infecting itself by rubbing the pathogen into the bite wound. What disease does <i>R. prowazekii</i> cause?</div>\n<div>\n<blockquote>scrub typhus = 5<br />\n<div>murine typhus = 6<br />\n<div>epidemic typhus = 7<br />\n<div>type O typhus = 8<br /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<div>E.

In other words, a typical evening in the A&T house. PING New email! Lemme just go check it out. A new cache, eh? Hmmmm...it's a new spitoony insect puzzle out near Columbia. I like a good puzzle! \n\nWait? What's this? More pings in rapid succession! Four more new caches, and more in the insect series, even! This is pretty cool, so I'm gonna have to work on this. The puzzles were good, and after some research and common sense I got them all solved. \n\nFast forward to today. I dropped the kid off at school early because he had a morning function. After doing that, I then  made the trek to the caches. Pleasant drive to the area as always. I really like the countryside in this area, so being able to see it was rather nice. \n\nAnyway, I got to the cache area, jumped out of the geo-mobile and began my hunt. I went directly to where the coordinates stated the cache should be and found nothing. I looked everywhere it should have been and came up blank. It was only when I looked in a spot it should not have been that I found it. Opening the cache, I was greeted by a pristine log sheet! I happily scribbled my FTF signature (with the wrong date...apparently I am still living in yesterday) and put everything back as it was.\n\nThanks for placing this cache for everyone, myself included, to enjoy! TNLN/SL TFTC!\n\nYes, we know where our towels are...\n\n-Fulton, MO"

The event went off without a hitch and the conditions couldn't have been better. The great weather continued into the afternoon, when it was at this point that I decided to go after these new caches.\n\nI saw one pop up the night before, but I was too pooped to go after it, having already traveled to Marshall, Sedalia, Jeff City and back home. No matter...another cacher got the well-earned FTF. Early this morning, however, I noticed five more caches publish. Hmmm...better get to work on them. I got all but one solved, and that one was quickly rectified after I got a tip from the cache owner. Solving them was all I could do, though, because I had an event to attend.\n\nAfter the event was over and we were heading back home, I noticed that the caches had remained unfound. What the heck, I thought...let's go for them! Best case scenario, I get a few FTF's and cache on a gorgeous day...worst case, I still get to cache on a gorgeous day! So, I loaded up the GPSr and scooted off down the road.\n\nThis cache was the third of the new caches I went after. As I neared ground zero, I had a good idea of what kind of hide it would be. I was right. Upon opening the cache, I discovered a nice, clean sheet yet again. After filling in the FTF spot, I put it back and set out for the next one.\n\nThanks for placing this cache for everyone, myself included, to enjoy! TNLN/SL TFTC!\n\nYes, we know where our towels are...\n\n-Fulton, MO"

The event went off without a hitch and the conditions couldn't have been better. The great weather continued into the afternoon, when it was at this point that I decided to go after these new caches.\n\nI saw one pop up the night before, but I was too pooped to go after it, having already traveled to Marshall, Sedalia, Jeff City and back home. No matter...another cacher got the well-earned FTF. Early this morning, however, I noticed five more caches publish. Hmmm...better get to work on them. I got all but one solved, and that one was quickly rectified after I got a tip from the cache owner. Solving them was all I could do, though, because I had an event to attend.\n\nAfter the event was over and we were heading back home, I noticed that the caches had remained unfound. What the heck, I thought...let's go for them! Best case scenario, I get a few FTF's and cache on a gorgeous day...worst case, I still get to cache on a gorgeous day! So, I loaded up the GPSr and scooted off down the road.\n\nThis cache was the fourth of the new caches I went after. I went to the ground zero of this one and set about looking in exactly the wrong spot. Readjusting my bearings, I found the right spot and found a cache that blended in very nicely. Opening it up, another virgin log sheet presented itself. I sullied its reputation and put it back and set out for the next one.\n\nThanks for placing this cache for everyone, myself included, to enjoy! TNLN/SL TFTC!\n\nYes, we know where our towels are...\n\n-Fulton, MO"

This day was no exception, and there was a series east of town to pursue.\n\nArriving at the coordinates, I parked the car and surveyed the area.  Quite a lot of brush appeared to be guarding the intended hiding place along with a plethora of birds!  I carefully searched but managed to irk one or two of the feathered creatures.  All but one flew away; perhaps they needed to keep an eye on me.  When the cache was discovered, I reasoned that the bird wouldn't tell.

The event went off without a hitch and the conditions couldn't have been better. The great weather continued into the afternoon, when it was at this point that I decided to go after these new caches.\n\nI saw one pop up the night before, but I was too pooped to go after it, having already traveled to Marshall, Sedalia, Jeff City and back home. No matter...another cacher got the well-earned FTF. Early this morning, however, I noticed five more caches publish. Hmmm...better get to work on them. I got all but one solved, and that one was quickly rectified after I got a tip from the cache owner. Solving them was all I could do, though, because I had an event to attend.\n\nAfter the event was over and we were heading back home, I noticed that the caches had remained unfound. What the heck, I thought...let's go for them! Best case scenario, I get a few FTF's and cache on a gorgeous day...worst case, I still get to cache on a gorgeous day! So, I loaded up the GPSr and scooted off down the road.\n\nThis cache was the fifth of the new caches I went after. For some reason, this one took me the longest to find. That cammo was really effective here! I eventually prevailed and found the cache and signed the log. I put it back and set out for the last one.\n\nThanks for placing this cache for everyone, myself included, to enjoy! TNLN/SL TFTC!\n\nYes, we know where our towels are...\n\n-Fulton, MO"

First I wasn't sure if I had one that I had solved, and had to check the web page to make sure the coords were the corrected coords I entered when I solved it.   Then my GPS put me about 30 feet east of the cache.   I did finally find it though and was able to sign the log and move on to the next cache of the day.  TFTC"

The event went off without a hitch and the conditions couldn't have been better. The great weather continued into the afternoon, when it was at this point that I decided to go after these new caches.\n\nI saw one pop up the night before, but I was too pooped to go after it, having already traveled to Marshall, Sedalia, Jeff City and back home. No matter...another cacher got the well-earned FTF. Early this morning, however, I noticed five more caches publish. Hmmm...better get to work on them. I got all but one solved, and that one was quickly rectified after I got a tip from the cache owner. Solving them was all I could do, though, because I had an event to attend.\n\nAfter the event was over and we were heading back home, I noticed that the caches had remained unfound. What the heck, I thought...let's go for them! Best case scenario, I get a few FTF's and cache on a gorgeous day...worst case, I still get to cache on a gorgeous day! So, I loaded up the GPSr and scooted off down the road.\n\nThis cache was the sixth and last of the new caches I went after. After getting FTF on the other caches, I wasn't as hopeful about getting here first on this one, seeing as it's closest to Columbia. When I finally got to the appointed spot, I parked along a side road and walked over to the cache site. I found the container and opened it...blank! Not believing it, I signed the FTF spot, making it my fifth FTF of the day. Nice! I put everything back and moseyed my way to Columbia to get a celebratory soda and go to a spot to look for a few mushrooms.\n\nThis was a great series! Thanks for placing this cache for everyone, myself included, to enjoy! TNLN/SL TFTC!\n\nYes, we know where our towels are...\n\n-Fulton, MO"

In other words, a typical evening in the A&T house. PING New email! Lemme just go check it out. A new cache, eh? Hmmmm...it's a new spitoony insect puzzle out near Columbia. I like a good puzzle!\n\nWait? What's this? More pings in rapid succession! Four more new caches, and more in the insect series, even! This is pretty cool, so I'm gonna have to work on this. The puzzles were good, and after some research and common sense I got them all solved.\n\nFast forward to today. I dropped the kid off at school early because he had a morning function. After doing that, I then made the trek to the caches. Pleasant drive to the area as always. I really like the countryside in this area, so being able to see it was rather nice.\n\nThis was the final cache on the run. Upon arriving near ground zero, I had a decent idea where it was and I was right. Quickly having cache in hand, I discovered that no one had been to this cache! Signing the FTF spot, I put it back and made my way back home. \n\nFour out of five caches isn't too bad! Thanks for this fun series. [:)]\n\nThanks for placing this cache for everyone, myself included, to enjoy! TNLN/SL TFTC!\n\nYes, we know where our towels are...\n\n-Fulton, MO"

Earwigs are known to practice rudimentary brood care, a type of behavior known as \u201csubsociality\u201d.

The St. Helena giant earwig <i>Labidura herculeana</i> is the largest earwig ever collected, reaching 78 mm (about 3 inches). It is now feared extinct.

The hardest part was to come:  waiting for an opportunity to seek them.\n\nOn this day, the wait ended.  I gathered the usual geocaching gear and set out to find a handful of this series before an appointment later on.  Pavement receded as gravel took over the road.  Soon, a likely location came into sight and was verified with the GPS.  Finding the container, though, took considerably longer.  Well done!

I like a good puzzle!\n\nWait? What's this? More pings in rapid succession! Four more new caches, and more in the insect series, even! This is pretty cool, so I'm gonna have to work on this. The puzzles were good, and after some research and common sense I got them all solved.\n\nFast forward to today. I dropped the kid off at school early because he had a morning function. After doing that, I then made the trek to the caches. Pleasant drive to the area as always. I really like the countryside in this area, so being able to see it was rather nice.\n\nHaving gotten the FTF near Columbia, I started the trek back toward home with this cache. I got to the cache area, parked and started the search. Something in the area stuck out to me and that was where the prize turned out to be. Retrieving the log sheet presented yet another unsigned FTF space, which I quickly filled up. \n\nNicely done on this cache! Favorite point for the container!

As we pulled up to GZ I realized that we had made a fatal mistake: *we forgot a pen*. We decided to find it anyway. We got a good laugh from the hide itself, I'm sure it's startled a few. We left a flower in the hide temporarily to prove our presence. I plan to stop by after work one day this week to put our names on the physical log. TFTC!"

Mantids, termites and cockroaches were once considered three different orders of insects (some authorities still consider the mantids separate from the cockroaches+termites).

In other words, a typical evening in the A&T house. PING New email! Lemme just go check it out. A new cache, eh? Hmmmm...it's a new spitoony insect puzzle out near Columbia. I like a good puzzle! \n\nWait? What's this? More pings in rapid succession! Four more new caches, and more in the insect series, even! This is pretty cool, so I'm gonna have to work on this. The puzzles were good, and after some research and common sense I got them all solved. \n\nFast forward to today. I dropped the kid off at school early because he had a morning function. After doing that, I then  made the trek to the caches. Pleasant drive to the area as always. I really like the countryside in this area, so being able to see it was rather nice. \n\nAfter the DNF on the second cache I went after, I sought this one out. I saw the likely spot that fit the hint and that is where the cache was hiding. Upon opening it, I was pleased to find another blank log sheet. Right on! I signed FTF and put it back and took off to the next cache.\n\nThanks for placing this cache for everyone, myself included, to enjoy! TNLN/SL TFTC!\n\nYes, we know where our towels are...\n\n-Fulton, MO"

After arriving at the parking lot of the church I realized I didn't have my gel pen so I fished through the wife's van for one.   She had plenty to chose from so I picked one..   This seems like rambling but it's important later....   So I  made my way through the graveyard perusing the headstones.  Quite a lot of old ones.   Finally I made it to ground zero, and had the cache quickly in hand.  Opened it up, examined the contents, then pulled out the log applied the pen to paper, nothing.   Scribbled on the page, nothing....   ugh, so now I walked back to the van, log in hand, went through the 10 or so pens in the console and found ONE THAT WORKED this time....   the returned back to the cache replaced it all.   Yep. Always check the pen before walking to the cache..  TFTC"

With sunny skies and temperatures in the 60's, who could resist getting out and enjoying the weather?  Roads rushed by as I drove highway 63 north and turned off on Hinton Road.  It wasn't until a departure to a driveway that the true extent of the ground saturation was realized.  Mud had seeped up and coated what was once gravel making parking an interesting task.  Would this be a continuing trend?\n\nThe graveyard was immensely interesting (if a bit slick)!  Several gravestones had tales to tell, and one sign indicated that another cemetery had been added to this one.  Photographs were taken to chronicle these echoes of the past.  Finding the geocaching during this tour was easy enough and illustrated a hidden gem.  Very cool!  The log was signed as per custom and all replaced as found.\n\nTook nothing, left Tommy the Tombstone Traveler TB."

I had never been here in Columbia when a new Columbia cache had published, save for one time at an event, so we decided to make a detour to go for it. The drive was pleasant and when we got to the area, there were no cars! I made my way to ground zero easily and had cache in hand quickly. I opened it up and was greeted by a virgin log, which I quickly deflowered with my signature. I put everything back and we zoomed of to go greet yoyoteacher at the finish line. Thanks for the cache and the fun!"

I told her that I'd already checked there, but she had the cache in her hand from the place I'd already checked, still slightly damaged by my fingernails on my first attempt.

Today I started in Ottumwa, IA with some foggy weather and got into some rather stormy conditions as I made my way into Missouri.  Eventually I punched through a line of thunderstorms while moving west from Edina to Kirksville.  The rest of the day was quite delightful and the weather kept getting better and better before ending in Columbia, MO.  Most of my good friends going to GWS were well on their way to the event and I had hoped to see some on the journey, but I wound up not crossing paths with anyone though I evidently crossed paths with some of my Maryland friends near Macon or Moberly today.  Lots of fun caches to be had today!\n\nI came to this small park after seeing the description for the nearby cache across the river.  I didn't realize that crossing the river was going to be a little rough so aborted that cache and went for this one instead.  Found it after a brief search in this somewhat nice hidden gem of a park."

There were some neat rock formations along the way.  \n\nOnce my GPSr settled a little bit, it brought me to the cache location pretty quickly, but the real clue was a single, yellow, star I saw lying on the ground.

Even though it's not well-advertised, the wonderful geologic formations nestled within the boundaries of this park are worth a visit. Access to this treasure is found easily off U.S. 63, about 12 miles north of Columbia.<br />\n<br />\nShelving Rock lies just downstream from the namesake Pinnacles. Exploring this feature, one begins to wonder if it has been used in the past for shelter by animals or man. On special days after it has rained, numerous faucets of water emanate from the interior wall, as if Mother Nature herself chose to equip this natural domicile with plumbing.<br />\n<br />\nStreams have a tendency to erode and undercut on the outside of bends because of centrifugal force. As the water carries silt, rocks and other materials, it acts as an abrasive agent against the rock. This action, combined with solution weathering (acids and chemicals which react with minerals on the bank, especially limestone), creates erosional features such as Shelving Rock. In this case, it was formed by the constant erosional action of the waters of Silver Fork, the same stream which helped to create the Pinnacles.<br />\n<br />\nMuch like the Pinnacles, Shelving Rock is composed of the Burlington Limestone, which is approximately 300 million years old. In many areas, this is an exceptionally pure limestone and is quarried at a number of points in eastern and central Missouri and as far southwest as Springfield, Missouri. This particular kind is famous for possessing many kinds of marine fossils, particularly crinoids. This limestone is the source material for the columns of the University of Missouri-Columbia's Red Campus and Boone County's Old Courthouse.<br />\n<br /></font></b>\n<center><b><font size=\"3\"><b><font size=\"2\">SOURCE: <u>Geologic Wonders and Curiosities</u> by Thomas R.

Today I started in Ottumwa, IA with some foggy weather and got into some rather stormy conditions as I made my way into Missouri.  Eventually I punched through a line of thunderstorms while moving west from Edina to Kirksville.  The rest of the day was quite delightful and the weather kept getting better and better before ending in Columbia, MO.  Most of my good friends going to GWS were well on their way to the event and I had hoped to see some on the journey, but I wound up not crossing paths with anyone though I evidently crossed paths with some of my Maryland friends near Macon or Moberly today.  Lots of fun caches to be had today!\n\nNice surprising spot to find in the middle of Missouri.  I had walked down the path to see what was here and noted how nice it was, but failed ot notice this EarthCache was here at first.  Only after finding a nearby traditional did I see I walked past the coordinates and then came right back to perform the tasks for the EC.\n\nI enjoyed the formation and the geology of the area!

These Sirens beckon the visitor to take heed of the wonderful geologic formations nestled within the boundaries of the Pinnacles Youth Park. Access to this treasure is found easily off U.S. 63, about 12 miles north of Columbia.<br />\n<br />\nThis slim ridge lies between two streams, Silver Fork and Kelley Branch. It was formed when Silver Fork doubled back on itself and met the parallel Kelley Branch. These streams crowded each other so closely that what remains is a precariously thin, approximately 1,000-foot ridge as an erosional remnant. One of the probable influences in this action are parallel vertical rock fracture planes that caused the streams to take the paths that they did.<br />\n<br />\nAll in all, the ridge itself doesn't have much time left, geologically-speaking, as it's only several feet wide at some points and has already been perforated a few times, leaving windows through the formation. At some point, probably in a few thousand years, either one of the streams will breach the ridge or it will collapse.<br />\n<br />\nThe Pinnacles are composed of the Burlington Limestone, which is approximately 300 million years old. In many areas, this is an exceptionally pure limestone and is quarried at a number of points in eastern and central Missouri and as far southwest as Springfield, Missouri. This particular kind is famous for possessing many kinds of marine fossils, particularly crinoids. This limestone is the source material for the columns of the University of Missouri-Columbia's Red Campus and Boone County's Old Courthouse.<br />\n<br /></font></b>\n<center><b><font size=\"3\"><b><font size=\"2\">SOURCE: <u>Geologic Wonders and Curiosities</u> by Thomas R.

A quick scramble across the (nearly bone dry) creek and up, and I had one of the best views in Boone County. I had to remind myself to get the information for the cache, since I was rather out of breath and fascinated by the trees, rocks, and view. The rocks were smooth under my hands from their prominent exposure. Trees cling to patches of soil, and look amazing in profile against the sky.\n\nI may have not done poetry for all the days of this challenge, but this spot could really inspire some."

I found out today that I didn't need to do that, so I could have completed this back in July of 2011.  Oh, well.  I was able to get the smiley today, at least.  \n\nI always enjoy hiking up the Pinnacles for the view and the exhilaration of the journey.  I had psyched myself up to make the crossing of the narrow ledge, just a bit beyond Waypoint two.  I was glad I didn't have to continue on, and was able to get all the answers I needed from there on back.  I will be back again to this one with the grandkids, once I figure out how to harness them to make sure they don't take any shortcuts to the bottom.  Thank you for publishing this Earthcache, A&T!"

I didn't have the GPS, since I got seperated from the group when I got stuck and said I'd go back down and meet them from another route, and then couldn't make myself take the last section down to the bottom. I finally found another way up. I read the earthcache page and got some of the info on the 10th, then talk pops into making and early cache run on the 11th to look for the traditional and finish getting the info on this one. I wrote it all down on my hand, but after I bit it on some wet rocks, I rubbed off half the info, along with a bunch of skin. At least I didn't fall from the top. This is such a cool place, my sister has lived in Columbia for 10+ years and I have visited many times and never knew about this place. I will definitely be back. Email will be sent."

The plan was to get to Saint Louis the fast way but to go home the long way. We plotted a route north of the interstate to grab us some Missouri counties for our challenge and also knocked some pages of the MO DeLorme challenge also. We completely succeeded and we had a really nice drive back home. It took us about 10 hours tho but it was worth it.\n\nEarthcaches rock my world literally. This one was not the exception and on the contrary it was like a huge mega earthquake when we discovered the Pinnacles standing in front of us. There were a group of youngster hanging out in the park and a couple rock climbing the Pinnacles. We were mesmerized by the size and height of them. It was awesome just watching them from the ground. Then we started our journey up. I was a bit worried about MothraMandy because she was wearing only flip flops and she has a bit of fear of heights but she did awesome. The climb was not too hard and when we reached the top of the Pinnacles I feel like I can touch the clouds. MothraMandy had a blast too and she faced her fear of heights like a champ. We were here about couple hours before sunset and the sun just hit the limestone rocks perfectly for good pictures. My phone died so MothraMandy had most of the shots. Great earthcache and awesome location. We were super delighted and happy that geocaching showed us such great hidden treasure. MothraMandy attende MU in Columbia and never heard about this park. It is definitively a must see area if you are crossing over the area. Super awesome earthcache. The trees growing on the limestone are amazing too. Their roots resemble natural bonsai roots growing on rocks."

Today I started in Ottumwa, IA with some foggy weather and got into some rather stormy conditions as I made my way into Missouri.  Eventually I punched through a line of thunderstorms while moving west from Edina to Kirksville.  The rest of the day was quite delightful and the weather kept getting better and better before ending in Columbia, MO.  Most of my good friends going to GWS were well on their way to the event and I had hoped to see some on the journey, but I wound up not crossing paths with anyone though I evidently crossed paths with some of my Maryland friends near Macon or Moberly today.  Lots of fun caches to be had today!\n\nNice bold hide!  Rarely see one hidden so \"open\" as this.  I enjoyed it and think it deserves a FP."

It was yet another day that required fulfillment for the geocaching challenge, and all prior attempts took me either west or south.  A new cache in Moberly prompted the change in compass direction.  Parking was easily found nearby; however, ice on the pavement brought forth caution.  Approaching the coordinates, a sizable tree stump was admired.  This must have been one large tree in its day!  The cache was spotted soon thereafter and quickly retrieved.  A new signature was added to the log book, and the container was replaced as found with a little bit of additional geocover.  Thanks for an interesting hide!\n\nTook nothing, left nothing."

It was very firmly iced into its spot!\n\nI made several trips to my car, trying various objects to scrape off or dislodge ice and cache. In the end, it was my trusty walking stick that levered it out! You know the quote, \"Give me a lever and a place to stand and I shall move the world.\" Which is what I did. \n\nI took the cache to a nearby table to sign. I took the candy, not a good cache item! And left one of the tools that is useful, just not for ice removal.\n\nThanks for the {*FTF*} and the really cool stump! When things thaw out, this might need better cover. If I were a kid, that location would be a playground!\n\nThis entry was edited by fearlessknits on Thursday, 06 March 2014 at 01:58:20 UTC."

I have chosen the area because there is many areas you can park and still get to more than one cache by walking and then can get back into your vehicle and park again to get the next set of caches. You can also if you want walk or bike the nice trails in the area to get to most of the caches. There are also many things to do in the park, plan to bring the family and stay for more enjoyment after your cache adventure that will take you to many areas of the park including around the lake which will give you good views. If you do bring your kids please watch them when around vehicle used areas and the lake caches are not next to the water and you will have several feet if they get away from you. Most to all the cache should not take long to find depending on your expertise.V1p3rx and I have worked to make the series fun and not finding the same old thing over and over. You will find a couple different styles of hides and also one that is maybe not be the expected way to retrieve the cache from the rest of the series. Stealth may be required due to being close to trails, or areas people may visit. We have attempted to give you geocover in all areas but it is a park. Please make sure the cache is hidden well when you place it back into its hiding spot. There is a archery range in the area so use caution even though caches are not placed in the area of the archery. Hope you enjoy the area and caches available in the park and this series. \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Charles (Sparky) Monroe Schulz was born on November 22nd, 1922 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, but grow up in St. Paul Minnesota at the age of 77 he passed away on February 12<sup>th</sup>, 2000 in Santa Rosa, California.

Asked the wife if she wanted to go for a drive and after completing a few errands we were off.   She relaxed with a book in the car on the way to Moberly and I planned on a few caches after getting a FTF.   Once we arrived at the park we admred the pretty scenery and then I put the rain coat on and made my way across the bridge.  I noticed a pretty little waterfall, took some pictures and then made my way to GZ.   After arriving at GZ I spotted the cache right off, but the approach was not clear.   How to reach the cache without getting completely soaked?  Finally I just dived in and pushed through to find a blank log... awesome FTF.   Signed the log, replaced the cache and made my way back to the car.  TFTC"

I have chosen the area because there is many areas you can park and still get to more than one cache by walking and then can get back into your vehicle and park again to get the next set of caches. You can also if you want walk or bike the nice trails in the area to get to most of the caches. There are also many things to do in the park, plan to bring the family and stay for more enjoyment after your cache adventure that will take you to many areas of the park including around the lake which will give you good views. If you do bring your kids please watch them when around vehicle used areas and the lake caches are not next to the water and you will have several feet if they get away from you. Most to all the cache should not take long to find depending on your expertise.V1p3rx and I have worked to make the series fun and not finding the same old thing over and over. You will find a couple different styles of hides and also one that is maybe not be the expected way to retrieve the cache from the rest of the series. Stealth may be required due to being close to trails, or areas people may visit. We have attempted to give you geocover in all areas but it is a park. Please make sure the cache is hidden well when you place it back into its hiding spot. There is a archery range in the area so use caution even though caches are not placed in the area of the archery. Hope you enjoy the area and caches available in the park and this series.\n<p>Charles (Sparky) Monroe Schulz was born on November 22nd, 1922 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, but grow up in St. Paul Minnesota at the age of 77 he passed away on February 12<sup>th</sup>, 2000 in Santa Rosa, California. Schulz first comic strip was called <em>Li\u2019l Folks and ran from June 1947-January 1950 in the</em> St. Paul Pioneer Press. In Li\u2019l Folks was the first time Schulz used the name Charlie Brown and he created a dog that also looked much like Snoopy. In May of 1948 Schulz sold the first of his one panel drawing to The Saturday Evening Post. After his Li\u2019l Folks comic strip was dropped in the 1950\u2019s, Schulz went to United Feature Syndicated with the one panel Li\u2019I Folks. Interested in his one panel comic, However Schulz had developed a normal four panel strip and at that time and United Feature Syndicated became interested and decided to publish a four panel comic. Peanuts made its debut on October 2<sup>nd</sup>, 1950, in seven different newspapers. The popular weekly Sunday page made its first appearance on January 6<sup>th</sup>, 1952. When the Peanuts comic strip was on top, it was published every day in 2,600 papers in 75 countries, 21 languages. In almost 50 years the Peanuts comic strip was produced Schulz drew nearly 18,000 strips. Between the comic strips, merchandise, product endorsement produced revenues of more than 1 billion per year. Schulz\u2019s estimated earrings was 30-40 million annually. The Peanuts comic strip only once why Schulz was alive have reshowings when Schulz went on vacation for five-weeks to celebrate his 75<sup>th</sup> birthday. Schulz never had assistants creating the strip and refused to hire an inker or letterer. On December 14<sup>th</sup> 1999 Schulz announced his retirement due to having several small strokes and a blocked aorta. It was later discovered he had colon cancer that had metastasized. Once Schulz started chemotherapy he was unable to see clearly. Schulz on February 12<sup>th</sup>, 2000 died in his sleep around 9:45 P.M. from colon cancer. The last original Peanuts comic strip was produced the next day on Sunday, February 13<sup>th</sup>. Charles Monroe Schulz is buried in Pleasant Hill Cemetery in Sebastopol, California.</p>\n<p>Woodstock-The first appearance for Woodstock was March 4<sup>th</sup>, 1966, Woodstock did not get a name until June 22<sup>nd</sup>, 1970. The last appearance for Woodstock was January 16<sup>th</sup>, 2000 in comic strip. Woodstock and Snoopy became friends in the daily strip when on April 4<sup>th</sup>, 1967 when Snoopy was on top of his dog house and a bird later called Woodstock landed on Snoop\u2019s nose and over the next two days began to talk to Snoopy about not liking having to fly South for the winter and how he was not blessed with good flying skills. When Woodstock talks its in chicken scratch with letters and punctuation to show usually sleep or emotions. Snoopy was the only one to really understand. Woodstock became Snoop\u2019s sidekick. The first Role Woodstock had was a Mechanic for Snoop\u2019s WWI Flying ace.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When Geocaching please respect and follow the rules of the park.</p>\n<p>The Park is open to the public daily from 5:00 a.m.-11:00 p.m.</p>\n<p>Do not damage any of the parks property, tress, or other wildlife.</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy the park and its amenities.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Congratulations to Arthur &amp; Trillian on FTF</p>"

Asked the wife if she wanted to go for a drive and after completing a few errands we were off.  After getting FTF on another cache in this series I decided to run over to this park and grab some of the series I didn't get on a previous trip as well as rectify a few DNFs.   I picked this one as it was closest.   The wife again stayed in the car as I made my search.   Cache was spotted quickly and I had to push my way into the spot to reach it.   Signed the log and returned to the car only to have my wife tell me I smelled like cat pee.   One thing about the tree that was at GZ, they tend to smell....  TFTC"

Well, I figured I was way too far away to even have a possibility to get them, so I reverently passed on them.\n\nFast forward to today. I was making my rounds on the internet when I checked the geocaching website and lo and behold, the caches were not found yet! What the heck, I figured...let's go for them!\n\nSo, I packed up my stuff and took off. In no time, I was there. I got to ground zero just fine and found the container. Finding it was no issue...retrieving it was. I am mildly allergic to the host spot. No matter, though...I got it!\n\nThanks for the fun cache! TNLN/SL TFTC!\n\n-Fulton, MO"

I have chosen the area because there is many areas you can park and still get to more than one cache by walking and then can get back into your vehicle and park again to get the next set of caches. You can also if you want walk or bike the nice trails in the area to get to most of the caches. There are also many things to do in the park, plan to bring the family and stay for more enjoyment after your cache adventure that will take you to many areas of the park including around the lake which will give you good views. If you do bring your kids please watch them when around vehicle used areas and the lake caches are not next to the water and you will have several feet if they get away from you. Most to all the cache should not take long to find depending on your expertise.V1p3rx and I have worked to make the series fun and not finding the same old thing over and over. You will find a couple different styles of hides and also one that is maybe not be the expected way to retrieve the cache from the rest of the series. Stealth may be required due to being close to trails, or areas people may visit. We have attempted to give you geocover in all areas but it is a park. Please make sure the cache is hidden well when you place it back into its hiding spot. There is a archery range in the area so use caution even though caches are not placed in the area of the archery. Hope you enjoy the area and caches available in the park and this series. \u00a0</p>\n<p>Charles (Sparky) Monroe Schulz was born on November 22nd, 1922 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, but grow up in St. Paul Minnesota at the age of 77 he passed away on February 12<sup>th</sup>, 2000 in Santa Rosa, California.

It pinged again...and again...and AGAIN! All told, I saw eight caches pop up! \n\nThere was no way I was going to let them slide, so I messaged dphickey and asked him if he wanted to go on an epic FTF run with me. At first he said he couldn't go. I knew I was going anyway, so I told him I'd check as I got closer to Columbia. Sure enough, when I got close to town, he said he was able and ready to go! I picked him up and we took off north to Moberly!\n\nThis was the first cache of the evening. We parked at the dog park lot and walked to the area the cache was in. After a little tree dodging, the cache was found. Opening it up, we were greeted by a pristine log! One problem, though...neither of us brought an implement to sully the log with out initials! Well, dphickey went back and got a pen and all was saved!\n\nFTF - 1\n\nThanks for the fun cache! TNLN/SL TFTC!\n\n-Fulton, MO"

A&T said he'd pick me up if I went out for the FTF with him.  Well the wife was still late so I said go without out me and continued making dinner.  When the wife finally got home, dinner was ready and once I completed dinner I got a message saying A&T was in COMO and wanted to know if I still couldn't go.   Well no excuse now, I was rushing around getting ready for caching in the dark.  Once he picked me up I worked quickly to enter the new cache coords into my old trusty 60CSX from my phone as we raced up 63.  This was the first cache we attempted.  We parked near the dog park and made our way to ground zero in the dark, and A&T made the quick find only to be foiled by him leaving his pen in the car and me leaving mine in my GPS case that I left on the picnic table near the car when I tied my shoes.  Easy enough solution, I made my way back to the table and retrieved my case and pen and we sign the log A&T and DPH.   Thanks for the new cache."

You can also if you want walk or bike the nice trails in the area to get to most of the caches. There are also many things to do in the park, plan to bring the family and stay for more enjoyment after your cache adventure that will take you to many areas of the park including around the lake which will give you good views. If you do bring your kids please watch them when around vehicle used areas and the lake caches are not next to the water and you will have several feet if they get away from you. Most to all the cache should not take long to find depending on your expertise.V1p3rx and I have worked to make the series fun and not finding the same old thing over and over. You will find a couple different styles of hides and also one that is maybe not be the expected way to retrieve the cache from the rest of the series. Stealth may be required due to being close to trails, or areas people may visit. We have attempted to give you geocover in all areas but it is a park. Please make sure the cache is hidden well when you place it back into its hiding spot. There is a archery range in the area so use caution even though caches are not placed in the area of the archery. Hope you enjoy the area and caches available in the park and this series. \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Charles (Sparky) Monroe Schulz was born on November 22nd, 1922 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, but grow up in St. Paul Minnesota at the age of 77 he passed away on February 12<sup>th</sup>, 2000 in Santa Rosa, California.

He wanted to avenge some DNF's, find some new caches and go for a FTF! Well, we teamed up to go accomplish these very goals. I needed a couple he had and he needed a couple I had, so with mutual goals, we set off!\n\nThis was one of the DNF's that I needed to avenge. It seemed that dphickey had already found this one, so it was up to me to complete the avenging process for the group. We got to the same parking area we went to last time and I prepared for a hunt. Armed with a better set of coordinates, I found the cache with no problems! I signed the log, happy to have avenged the DNF!\n\nThe cache is a bit distant from the posted numbers, so here are the coordinates I used to find the cache. They may not be exact, but they will bring you a lot closer to where the cache will be.\n\nThanks for the fun cache! TNLN/SL TFTC!\n\n-Fulton, MO"

I logged on to Geocaching.com and browsed around and noticed that there was a cache in Moberly that had not been found yet.   FTF run?   Why not.  Asked the wife if she wanted to go for a drive and after completing a few errands we were off.  After FTF and a find on two other caches in this series I decided to attempt to revenge the DNF I had on a previous visit.   The rain was steady by light and there was much more light than my previous visit but that didn't help much.   GPS pointed me right back to the spot I was in the previous night.   So I did the search as before, expanded it a bit, checked the hint, started over and searched more, expanded even farther...   Finally I decided it was time for a PAF.   Drat the phone number of my source was deleted when my phone had that hiccup....  Searching previous call logs rectified the situation, and the information that the coords may be a bit off was given.  Given new data I focused my search and sure enough the cache was found.  Retrieving it took a bit of work, and a madeshift TOTT that I fashioned out of some debris nearby and cache was in hand and signed.   Replacing the cache took a bit of work but once done all was good and ready for the finder.   This was the last of the day as once again it was getting dark and the other DNF nearby had a muggle parked right at GZ doing who knows what..   Decided to call it a day.   TFTC"

A-ha!  There the cache was!  Retrieving it was a fairly interesting process.  Very nice!  With the log signed and all returned as found, I walked back to the car.

At first he said he couldn't go. I knew I was going anyway, so I told him I'd check as I got closer to Columbia. Sure enough, when I got close to town, he said he was able and ready to go! I picked him up and we took off north to Moberly!\n\nThis was the second cache of the evening. We had a good idea where the cache should have been...that much is certain. Fate, however, decided to play with us. Our GPSr's bouncing between three trees, we couldn't quite get a lock on things. I searched what I felt was the likely spot, but came up with nothing.

We even have some antique cars and trucks, in the parade.....\nBTW, we want to THANK YOU, for your Cache(s) and maybe one day we'll BCNU down the road..\nMuffkin42 X 2 (MSgt/Ret. & Vietnam Vet)\nRon & Carol\n.[8D]..&...[8)]\nVinton, IA.\nPS The cache was only in a Sandwich bag..

I have chosen the area because there is many areas you can park and still get to more than one cache by walking and then can get back into your vehicle and park again to get the next set of caches. You can also if you want walk or bike the nice trails in the area to get to most of the caches. There are also many things to do in the park, plan to bring the family and stay for more enjoyment after your cache adventure that will take you to many areas of the park including around the lake which will give you good views. If you do bring your kids please watch them when around vehicle used areas and the lake caches are not next to the water and you will have several feet if they get away from you. Most to all the cache should not take long to find depending on your expertise.V1p3rx and I have worked to make the series fun and not finding the same old thing over and over. You will find a couple different styles of hides and also one that is maybe not be the expected way to retrieve the cache from the rest of the series. Stealth may be required due to being close to trails, or areas people may visit. We have attempted to give you geocover in all areas but it is a park. Please make sure the cache is hidden well when you place it back into its hiding spot. There is a archery range in the area so use caution even though caches are not placed in the area of the archery. Hope you enjoy the area and caches available in the park and this series. \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Charles (Sparky) Monroe Schulz was born on November 22nd, 1922 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, but grow up in St. Paul Minnesota at the age of 77 he passed away on February 12<sup>th</sup>, 2000 in Santa Rosa, California. Schulz first comic strip was called <em>Li\u2019l Folks and ran from June 1947-January 1950 in the</em> St. Paul Pioneer Press. In Li\u2019l Folks was the first time Schulz used the name Charlie Brown and he created a dog that also looked much like Snoopy. In May of 1948 Schulz sold the first of his one panel drawing to The Saturday Evening Post.

Peanuts made its debut on October 2<sup>nd</sup>, 1950, in seven different newspapers. The popular weekly Sunday page made its first appearance on January 6<sup>th</sup>, 1952. When the Peanuts comic strip was on top, it was published every day in 2,600 papers in 75 countries, 21 languages. In almost 50 years the Peanuts comic strip was produced Schulz drew nearly 18,000 strips. Between the comic strips, merchandise, product endorsement produced revenues of more than 1 billion per year. Schulz\u2019s estimated earrings was 30-40 million annually. The Peanuts comic strip only once why Schulz was alive have reshowings when Schulz went on vacation for five-weeks to celebrate his 75<sup>th</sup> birthday. Schulz never had assistants creating the strip and refused to hire an inker or letterer. On December 14<sup>th</sup> 1999 Schulz announced his retirement due to having several small strokes and a blocked aorta. It was later discovered he had colon cancer that had metastasized. Once Schulz started chemotherapy he was unable to see clearly. Schulz on February 12<sup>th</sup>, 2000 died in his sleep around 9:45 P.M. from colon cancer.

Pig Pen was most often seen in dirty overalls with a cloud of dust and dirt following him everywhere he goes. Pig Pen refers to the dust and dirt as the dust of ancient civilizations. Despite not being able to stay clean Charlie Brown accepts him for who he is and defends his uncleanliness in one comic strip and then again in A Charlie Brown Christmas. Pig Pen began being seen on T.V. Specials in the 1960\u2019s, and in all four movies.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"line-height:1.6;\">When Geocaching please respect and follow the rules of the park.</span></p>\n<p>The Park is open to the public daily from 5:00 a.m.-11:00 p.m.</p>\n<p>Do not damage any of the parks property, tress, or other wildlife.</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy the park and its amenities.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Congratulations to Arthur &amp; Trillian &amp; dphicky on Co- FTF</p>"

At first he said he couldn't go. I knew I was going anyway, so I told him I'd check as I got closer to Columbia. Sure enough, when I got close to town, he said he was able and ready to go! I picked him up and we took off north to Moberly!\n\nThis was the seventh cache of the evening. We arrived at the location for this cache and walked cheerily to ground zero.

You can also if you want walk or bike the nice trails in the area to get to most of the caches. There are also many things to do in the park, plan to bring the family and stay for more enjoyment after your cache adventure that will take you to many areas of the park including around the lake which will give you good views. If you do bring your kids please watch them when around vehicle used areas and the lake caches are not next to the water and you will have several feet if they get away from you. Most to all the cache should not take long to find depending on your expertise.V1p3rx and I have worked to make the series fun and not finding the same old thing over and over. You will find a couple different styles of hides and also one that is maybe not be the expected way to retrieve the cache from the rest of the series. Stealth may be required due to being close to trails, or areas people may visit. We have attempted to give you geocover in all areas but it is a park. Please make sure the cache is hidden well when you place it back into its hiding spot. There is a archery range in the area so use caution even though caches are not placed in the area of the archery. Hope you enjoy the area and caches available in the park and this series. \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Charles (Sparky) Monroe Schulz was born on November 22nd, 1922 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, but grow up in St. Paul Minnesota at the age of 77 he passed away on February 12<sup>th</sup>, 2000 in Santa Rosa, California. Schulz first comic strip was called <em>Li\u2019l Folks and ran from June 1947-January 1950 in the</em> St. Paul Pioneer Press. In Li\u2019l Folks was the first time Schulz used the name Charlie Brown and he created a dog that also looked much like Snoopy. In May of 1948 Schulz sold the first of his one panel drawing to The Saturday Evening Post. After his Li\u2019l Folks comic strip was dropped in the 1950\u2019s, Schulz went to United Feature Syndicated with the one panel Li\u2019I Folks. Interested in his one panel comic, However Schulz had developed a normal four panel strip and at that time and United Feature Syndicated became interested and decided to publish a four panel comic. Peanuts made its debut on October 2<sup>nd</sup>, 1950, in seven different newspapers. The popular weekly Sunday page made its first appearance on January 6<sup>th</sup>, 1952. When the Peanuts comic strip was on top, it was published every day in 2,600 papers in 75 countries, 21 languages. In almost 50 years the Peanuts comic strip was produced Schulz drew nearly 18,000 strips. Between the comic strips, merchandise, product endorsement produced revenues of more than 1 billion per year. Schulz\u2019s estimated earrings was 30-40 million annually. The Peanuts comic strip only once why Schulz was alive have reshowings when Schulz went on vacation for five-weeks to celebrate his 75<sup>th</sup> birthday. Schulz never had assistants creating the strip and refused to hire an inker or letterer. On December 14<sup>th</sup> 1999 Schulz announced his retirement due to having several small strokes and a blocked aorta. It was later discovered he had colon cancer that had metastasized. Once Schulz started chemotherapy he was unable to see clearly. Schulz on February 12<sup>th</sup>, 2000 died in his sleep around 9:45 P.M. from colon cancer. The last original Peanuts comic strip was produced the next day on Sunday, February 13<sup>th</sup>. Charles Monroe Schulz is buried in Pleasant Hill Cemetery in Sebastopol, California.</p>\n<p>Franklin Armstrong Was introduced July 31<sup>st</sup>, 1968 as the first black charter in the comic strip. His last appearance was November 5<sup>th,</sup> 1999 until he appeared in The Peanuts Movie on November 6<sup>th</sup>, 2015. He went to school with Peppermint Patty and Marcie in his first story, Charlie Brown and Franklin meet on the beach. His father was a solder in the Vietnam War.\u00a0 Franklin was introduced to the peanuts gang when a Los Angeles school teacher named Harriet Glickman wrote Schultz in the spring of 1968 asking him to bring a black character to the comic strip. His last name is consider a apocryphal because the only time his last name is talked about is in the T.V. special you\u2019re in the Super Bowl, Charlie Brown. He is only referred as Franklin in the Comic Strip and other T.V. specials.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When Geocaching please respect and follow the rules of the park.</p>\n<p>The Park is open to the public daily from 5:00 a.m.-11:00 p.m.</p>\n<p>Do not damage any of the parks property, tress, or other wildlife.</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy the park and its amenities.\u00a0\u00a0</p>"

I have chosen the area because there is many areas you can park and still get to more than one cache by walking and then can get back into your vehicle and park again to get the next set of caches. You can also if you want walk or bike the nice trails in the area to get to most of the caches. There are also many things to do in the park, plan to bring the family and stay for more enjoyment after your cache adventure that will take you to many areas of the park including around the lake which will give you good views. If you do bring your kids please watch them when around vehicle used areas and the lake caches are not next to the water and you will have several feet if they get away from you. Most to all the cache should not take long to find depending on your expertise.V1p3rx and I have worked to make the series fun and not finding the same old thing over and over. You will find a couple different styles of hides and also one that is maybe not be the expected way to retrieve the cache from the rest of the series. Stealth may be required due to being close to trails, or areas people may visit. We have attempted to give you geocover in all areas but it is a park. Please make sure the cache is hidden well when you place it back into its hiding spot. There is a archery range in the area so use caution even though caches are not placed in the area of the archery. Hope you enjoy the area and caches available in the park and this series. \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Charles (Sparky) Monroe Schulz was born on November 22nd, 1922 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, but grow up in St. Paul Minnesota at the age of 77 he passed away on February 12<sup>th</sup>, 2000 in Santa Rosa, California.

It pinged again...and again...and AGAIN! All told, I saw eight caches pop up!\n\nThere was no way I was going to let them slide, so I messaged dphickey and asked him if he wanted to go on an epic FTF run with me. At first he said he couldn't go. I knew I was going anyway, so I told him I'd check as I got closer to Columbia. Sure enough, when I got close to town, he said he was able and ready to go! I picked him up and we took off north to Moberly!\n\nThis was the eighth and final cache of the evening. We arrived at the best location I could find to park and set off into the woods. We walked to and fro and about halfway into the trip, the batteries on my GPSr died! Oh well...here comes the phone! Not my favorite way, but you gotta do what you gotta do. Anyway, we made the journey just fine and found the final pristine log.\n\nFTF-6 DNF-2\n\nThanks for the fun cache! TNLN/SL TFTC!\n\n-Fulton, MO"

We parked .21 miles from the cache and made our way to GZ via an access road new the children's train tracks. Then things got tougher as the road veered off and we bushwhacked into the woods at around  .1 mile from the cache.   The closer we got the more I ran into sticker bushes and low hanging branches....   I don't recommend being crazy like some certain cachers who did this at night.   But it's December and I didn't run into any spider webs or pick up any ticks and we were geocaching... so all was good.   Once we got withing 20 feet we saw what we thought would be the spot and sure enough there was stoic piano player with the clean log that we got to put the first signatures on.   All in all a great series and I will definitely return for the 2 DNFS and the 2 or 3 of the other caches in the series that were published earlier.  TFTC!"

I have chosen the area because there is many areas you can park and still get to more than one cache by walking and then can get back into your vehicle and park again to get the next set of caches. You can also if you want walk or bike the nice trails in the area to get to most of the caches. There are also many things to do in the park, plan to bring the family and stay for more enjoyment after your cache adventure that will take you to many areas of the park including around the lake which will give you good views. If you do bring your kids please watch them when around vehicle used areas and the lake caches are not next to the water and you will have several feet if they get away from you. Most to all the cache should not take long to find depending on your expertise.V1p3rx and I have worked to make the series fun and not finding the same old thing over and over. You will find a couple different styles of hides and also one that is maybe not be the expected way to retrieve the cache from the rest of the series. Stealth may be required due to being close to trails, or areas people may visit. We have attempted to give you geocover in all areas but it is a park. Please make sure the cache is hidden well when you place it back into its hiding spot. There is a archery range in the area so use caution even though caches are not placed in the area of the archery. Hope you enjoy the area and caches available in the park and this series. \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Charles (Sparky) Monroe Schulz was born on November 22nd, 1922 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, but grow up in St. Paul Minnesota at the age of 77 he passed away on February 12<sup>th</sup>, 2000 in Santa Rosa, California.

It's amazing how much changes in just a few years; I remember this area simply being a field with some sparse trees!  Soon, leaving the path was necessary for finding the cache.  The hide was discovered with little difficulty but required a bit of a stretch to reach.  With the log signed, I returned to the car.\n\nThere were three other hides just on the other side of the Christmas light display.  Hmmm . . . how would I get over there?  Soon, I was in line for the light show to scope out potential approaches (and to enjoy the drive).  Who knew that Moberly had a moose crossing or that Santa drove a tractor?  [:P]  It was a nicely put together and enjoyable event.\n\nComing to the end, I parked and decided to dare walking across the show to the caches.  I darted into the shadows whenever a car approached and soon entered the woods.  A disc golf course pathway was followed but only to a point.  The telltale yips and barks of several coyote caught my attention.  Nope!  There was no way I would risk running into a pack of coyote for a cache.  Those on the other side of the light show would have to wait until another day."

It pinged again...and again...and AGAIN! All told, I saw eight caches pop up!\n\nThere was no way I was going to let them slide, so I messaged dphickey and asked him if he wanted to go on an epic FTF run with me. At first he said he couldn't go. I knew I was going anyway, so I told him I'd check as I got closer to Columbia. Sure enough, when I got close to town, he said he was able and ready to go! I picked him up and we took off north to Moberly!\n\nThis was the sixth cache of the evening. We arrived at the location for this cache and walked cheerily to ground zero.

I have chosen the area because there is many areas you can park and still get to more than one cache by walking and then can get back into your vehicle and park again to get the next set of caches. You can also if you want walk or bike the nice trails in the area to get to most of the caches. There are also many things to do in the park, plan to bring the family and stay for more enjoyment after your cache adventure that will take you to many areas of the park including around the lake which will give you good views. If you do bring your kids please watch them when around vehicle used areas and the lake caches are not next to the water and you will have several feet if they get away from you. Most to all the cache should not take long to find depending on your expertise.V1p3rx and I have worked to make the series fun and not finding the same old thing over and over. You will find a couple different styles of hides and also one that is maybe not be the expected way to retrieve the cache from the rest of the series. Stealth may be required due to being close to trails, or areas people may visit. We have attempted to give you geocover in all areas but it is a park. Please make sure the cache is hidden well when you place it back into its hiding spot. There is a archery range in the area so use caution even though caches are not placed in the area of the archery. Hope you enjoy the area and caches available in the park and this series. \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Charles (Sparky) Monroe Schulz was born on November 22nd, 1922 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, but grow up in St. Paul Minnesota at the age of 77 he passed away on February 12<sup>th</sup>, 2000 in Santa Rosa, California.

So today, with nothing better to do, I decided to run to Moberly and find all the caches I have not found yet in the series and not in the series.  Then Arthur and Trillian texted me and I filled him in on my plans.   We modified our plans for him to join me and grab the caches he needed.    After the FTF find, we both wanted to revenge the DNF we had on this on our last FTF trip.   After pulling up and parking A&T started to read Unitzoid's FTF log.  One line in the log made me think that the cache was not in the area we searched before and I immediately started looking for areas that fit the other hides in the series.  Bingo, I spotted it from about 15 feet away.   A quick read of the GPS showed it was about 60 feet off from the posted coords.  I signed the log as A&T took a reading to share for future finders.

He wanted to avenge some DNF's, find some new caches and go for a FTF! Well, we teamed up to go accomplish these very goals. I needed a couple he had and he needed a couple I had, so with mutual goals, we set off!\n\nThis was one of the DNF's that we both needed to avenge. We got to the same parking area we went to last time and prepared to engage in a long hunt. I was barely out of the vehicle, ready to get to business, when all of a sudden dphickey announced he had found it! So quickly? Yes he did! It's like he channeled the cache owner's knowledge. No matter...we signed the log, happy to have avenged the DNF we had earlier.\n\nWe noticed the cache was about 60-65 feet away from where ground zero was, so we took a new set of coordinates. They may not be exact, but they will bring you a lot closer to where  the cache will be.\n\nThanks for the fun cache! TNLN/SL TFTC!\n\n-Fulton, MO"

At first he said he couldn't go. I knew I was going anyway, so I told him I'd check as I got closer to Columbia. Sure enough, when I got close to town, he said he was able and ready to go! I picked him up and we took off north to Moberly!\n\nThis was the fifth cache of the evening. We arrived at the location for this cache and began the search. We searched and we searched. We consulted the hint and that didn't do us much good, since the hint was kind of vague, given the area.

I have chosen the area because there is many areas you can park and still get to more than one cache by walking and then can get back into your vehicle and park again to get the next set of caches. You can also if you want walk or bike the nice trails in the area to get to most of the caches. There are also many things to do in the park, plan to bring the family and stay for more enjoyment after your cache adventure that will take you to many areas of the park including around the lake which will give you good views. If you do bring your kids please watch them when around vehicle used areas and the lake caches are not next to the water and you will have several feet if they get away from you. Most to all the cache should not take long to find depending on your expertise.V1p3rx and I have worked to make the series fun and not finding the same old thing over and over. You will find a couple different styles of hides and also one that is maybe not be the expected way to retrieve the cache from the rest of the series. Stealth may be required due to being close to trails, or areas people may visit. We have attempted to give you geocover in all areas but it is a park. Please make sure the cache is hidden well when you place it back into its hiding spot. There is a archery range in the area so use caution even though caches are not placed in the area of the archery. Hope you enjoy the area and caches available in the park and this series. \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Charles (Sparky) Monroe Schulz was born on November 22nd, 1922 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, but grow up in St. Paul Minnesota at the age of 77 he passed away on February 12<sup>th</sup>, 2000 in Santa Rosa, California.

It pinged again...and again...and AGAIN! All told, I saw eight caches pop up!\n\nThere was no way I was going to let them slide, so I messaged dphickey and asked him if he wanted to go on an epic FTF run with me. At first he said he couldn't go. I knew I was going anyway, so I told him I'd check as I got closer to Columbia. Sure enough, when I got close to town, he said he was able and ready to go! I picked him up and we took off north to Moberly!\n\nThis was the fourth cache of the evening. I pulled into the park, only to see the gates closed and locked. Looking at the cache page, it said that the park closed at 11 p.m., so we went for it, leaving the car parked at the gate. We walked to the appointed area and I immediately beaded onto a likely spot. Searching high and low yielded nothing until I glanced at another nearby tree where this was hidden. Bingo.\n\nFTF-3 DNF-1\n\nThanks for the fun cache! TNLN/SL TFTC!\n\n-Fulton, MO"

Hours on the cache page indicated we were well within the hours of the park so we walked the rest of the way in, and after arriving at what appeared to be GZ we came up blank.

So today, with nothing better to do, I decided to run to Moberly and find all the caches I have not found yet in the series and not in the series.  Then Arthur and Trillian texted me and I filled him in on my plans.   We modified our plans for him to join me and grab the caches he needed.    Finally we arrived at the last cache in the park I had not found.  We made our way down the access road and onto ground zero.  I spotted the telltale tree right off.   Logged the cache and we headed off to another park so A&T could log the last of the Peanuts caches he needed.  TFTC!"

New, it's not safe to check them while driving, so at the first convenient spot, I looked to see what was up. Two new caches in Moberly! Well, I figured I was way too far away to even have a possibility to get them, so I reverently passed on them.\n\nFast forward to today. I was making my rounds on the internet when I checked the geocaching website and lo and behold, the caches were not found yet! What the heck, I figured...let's go for them!\n\nSo, I packed up my stuff and took off. In no time, I was there. I got to ground zero just fine and found the container. I had an idea what I was looking for, and my hunch paid off. Nice placement!\n\nThanks for the fun cache! TNLN/SL TFTC!\n\n-Fulton, MO"

Which he did.\u00a0 Reassembly was performed later by Dad.\u00a0 He liked to see how things worked and had an aptitude for mechanical and electrical work.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>John enjoyed sports and excelled as a Junior Bowler and attended State tournaments with his friends on Rancho Bowl teams.\u00a0 After he grew up and left home he almost always had two bowling balls in the trunk of his car, in case a bowling opportunity materialized.\u00a0 He took up throwing the Discus in High School and in his Senior year he went to the California Southern Section CIF finals to qualify for the state tournament and missed qualifying by one slot, they took 9 throwers and John finished 10<sup>th</sup> with his best throw of the season.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>John was a great person and devoted to his friends and family.\u00a0 He was not lucky in love.\u00a0 He wanted the dream, but the women he chose did not. He stayed for 5 years with the first love and finally ended it with no children.\u00a0 He then married a woman with 3 children and was happy to act as their father for 9 years.\u00a0 Kayla, Alexis and Kenneth (Bubba) Smart were very much loved by John, and were placed with their biological Dad after his second divorce.\u00a0 However he did get full custody of his children from that marriage , Emily and Matthew.\u00a0 His greatest joy was the successes of all 5 of the children and he enjoyed sharing their stories.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>John joined the Army in May of 1999, not wanting to go to college at the time, but looking for training he could use in life, plus the benefits of college subsidies he could use later.\u00a0 He went to a 9 month Medical Equipment Course and was the honor graduate.\u00a0 Because of his ability to assimilate and retain information, he was able to not only utilize his high school education to advance him in his class, but also to tutored others who were struggling.\u00a0 John was sent to Kuwait and then into Iraq as a part of the invasion force in 2003.\u00a0 He left the Army with an honorable discharge in May 2005, because he did not want to be separated from his family in the future.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>John then moved his family from his last Military duty station in San Antonio, TX to Columbia, MO, where he worked for Modern Biomedical Services, Inc. in support of the Moberly Regional Medical Center (MRMC).\u00a0 He was a Bio-Medical Technician there, repairing and maintaining medical equipment within the hospital complex.\u00a0 He loved his job and the people he worked with both within Modern Biomedical and MRMC.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The friends he met through work and outside work, in his community, were important to him and he was always willing and able to lend a helping hand when needed.\u00a0 He loved to coach discus and found a small school that could use his help.\u00a0 He also helped coach his children's teams as they began playing</p>\n<p>sports.\u00a0 He was active in helping his children succeed in school and placed a heavy emphasis on the importance of school in them.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>While the help he provided to others was part of his legacy, their help in working him through the rough parts of his life was also\u00a0 important. The people that knew him always describe him as happy and cheerful to all.\u00a0 He was moving his life into a better place after his last divorce and his positive attitude was shining through.\u00a0 It was a tragedy when a drunk driver, going the wrong way on a divided highway, ended his young life on 11 March 2014.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>John made the world around him a better place while he was here and no one can ask more than that.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>"

Eventually I punched through a line of thunderstorms while moving west from Edina to Kirksville.  The rest of the day was quite delightful and the weather kept getting better and better before ending in Columbia, MO.  Most of my good friends going to GWS were well on their way to the event and I had hoped to see some on the journey, but I wound up not crossing paths with anyone though I evidently crossed paths with some of my Maryland friends near Macon or Moberly today.  Lots of fun caches to be had today!\n\nVery nice hide, and sorry for your loss.  John was only a few months older than myself and read your memorial on the cache page.

It is worrisome when a cache with a successful find history has a string of DNF's. The geocaching community would like to know how it's going here. Is your cache still here, is it being worked on, that sort of thing. When you get a chance, please log onto your page and give everyone an update by posting a note to your cache page.\n\nIf it is not disabled already, I will temporarily disable your cache   to give you an opportunity to stop by and check on your cache.\n\nIf you haven't had time to check on it by my next check I'll go ahead and archive it then.\nIf you decide that this project has reached its end you can archive it now to remove it from the active cache database.\n\nWhen everything is OK again, please remember to enable your cache and post an \"Owner Maintenance\" log on your cache page. This log removes the \"needs maintenance\" and allows your cache to be shown in the search results of Pocket Queries. Don't let your cache be filtered out unnecessarily in Pocket Queries by forgetting to reset the attribute!\nI want to thank you for the time that you have taken to contribute to Geocaching in the past and I am looking forward to hopefully seeing your cache up and running in the near future.\n\nHOW TO RESPOND IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS\nRespond by posting a new Note. Go to the cache page in question, and click on Log Your Visit. Select \"Post Note\" as the log type, and enter your message. Doing that, I'll know exactly what cache your message pertains to, which will speed the communication process.\nIf you're reading this as an email, don't reply to the sending address. It won't reach me. Follow the contact instructions above.\n\n\n----\n***Thanks a MILLION, Glenn***\n***\"Seek quality, not quantity\"***\n--Your friendly Missouri Geocache Review team is:\n ***[*gln](http://www.geocaching.com/profile/?u=*gln), [Mongo](http://www.geocaching.com/profile/?u=Mongo) and [Banjo-Boy](http://www.geocaching.com/profile/?u=Banjo-Boy)***\n \n----\n\n\n{#9ddb5344ab12c87d822207f045e268c2}"

Needless to say we stopped for the night in Kirksville, MO and decided to local cache in the snow and it turned out to be very fun!\n\nquick and easy smiley to log on the snow trip back to Columbia ... curious as to what was in the backpack ...hmmmm?"

Yes, that would be the same day a snowstorm was predicted to blow through. Despite logic, our adventurous streak prevailed, and we left from Columbia, MO, early in the day to visit Ottumwa, IA, where November Ghost has family roots. Ottumwa is quite charming! I learned how delicious a canteen lunch is while overhearing the locals discussing the brewing snow. Still un-phased by the talk of ferocious flurries, we spent the afternoon finding many fine caches. Our trip included a visit to Ghost\u2019s past and a test of courage involving climbing up the slippery branches of a tree in the rain. You bet we exchanged some high fives after tackling that one. Around 5 or 6, it finally dawned on us that there was supposed to be some inclement weather on the way. Still, we dilly-dallied at a diner before finally getting out on the road as the sun was setting. Did I mention that I\u2019m from the south, and that I\u2019d never driven through snow before? November Ghost was behind the wheel\u2026 but that doesn\u2019t mean he could actually see the road. And neither could I. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been that terrified due to weather. Now I know what those bumps on the sides of the lane are for! Driving blind proved to be much too stressful, so we stopped in Kirksville, MO for the night (and I found my first cache in the snow!) We made it home safe and sound on Sunday morning, and with a hearty respect for Mother Nature. Many thanks to all of the cachers who placed the hides we found on our trip!\n\nSunday morning, I woke up to a lovely blanket of snow and took the geo-pibble for a walk in it. Turns out, she loves snow! After a morning meetup at the golden arches for coffee, November Ghost and I took the jeep out to make some fresh tracks through the field of white. There was a backpack on the ground near the cache. And some plastic grocery bags filled with brown lumps. Yeah... thanks for the smiley anyway!"

Despite logic, our adventurous streak prevailed, and we left from Columbia, MO, early in the day to visit Ottumwa, IA, where November Ghost has family roots. Ottumwa is quite charming! I learned how delicious a canteen lunch is while overhearing the locals discussing the brewing snow. Still un-phased by the talk of ferocious flurries, we spent the afternoon finding many fine caches. Our trip included a visit to Ghost\u2019s past and a test of courage involving climbing up the slippery branches of a tree in the rain. You bet we exchanged some high fives after tackling that one. Around 5 or 6, it finally dawned on us that there was supposed to be some inclement weather on the way. Still, we dilly-dallied at a diner before finally getting out on the road as the sun was setting. Did I mention that I\u2019m from the south, and that I\u2019d never driven through snow before? November Ghost was behind the wheel\u2026 but that doesn\u2019t mean he could actually see the road. And neither could I. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been that terrified due to weather. Now I know what those bumps on the sides of the lane are for! Driving blind proved to be much too stressful, so we stopped in Kirksville, MO for the night (and I found my first cache in the snow!) We made it home safe and sound on Sunday morning, and with a hearty respect for Mother Nature. Many thanks to all of the cachers who placed the hides we found on our trip!\n\nSunday morning, I woke up to a lovely blanket of snow and took the geo-pibble for a walk in it. Turns out, she loves snow! After a morning meetup at the golden arches for coffee, November Ghost and I took the jeep out to make some fresh tracks through the field of white. We found this cache with ease, signed the log, and continued on our way home. Thanks for the smiley!"

We need to be home, and prepare for the Veteran's 4th Annual, Lighted Christmas Parade, in Vinton, IA., the Thursday evening (6 PM)(it's DARK), before Thanksgiving.. (The VFW and AmVets got this Parade started four years ago).. Our Veterans Foreign Wars (VFW), American Veterans (AmVets), American Legion, and Vinton's Vol. Fire Dept., all get together for this Parade.. LOTS of business owners put in their lighted \"floats\", etc. Really a VERY Pretty Parade, with all the Christmas lighted entries.. We even have some antique cars and trucks, in the parade.....\nBTW, we want to THANK YOU, for your Cache(s) and maybe one day we'll BCNU down the road..\nMuffkin42 X 2 (MSgt/Ret. & Vietnam Vet)\nRon & Carol\n.[8D]..&...[8)]\nVinton, IA."

We left Thursday morning at 4:15 from Colorado and arrived at the hotel in St. Lewis MO 20 hours later.  Caching along the way always seams to make the time go by faster, but also adds 6 hours to the trip.  \nWe only found 100 caches total including all the events.  Every one of the caches was special for some reason.  I picked up 35+ new counties, several virtuals, larges, Earth caches, letterboxes, and a couple wherigos we even found about 50 waymarks, some benchmarks and some labs caches.  Some highlights of the trip were seeing the arch, seeing a flash mob broken up by police, SWAG Dragon falling flat into a ditch full of stinky water, being at our first Geowoodstock, and exploring some of the rich local history.  I enjoyed seeing some fellow Colorado cachers 1000 miles away.  The answers for the VCs, and ECs are being sent by Joe Friday, OneKindWord or Egnix.  Let me know if I need to sort through the pics and notes and answer myself. We used a group stamp most of the time. Thank you for placing this cache and keeping it going.  I am glad it was a part of the overall experience of going on a road trip to Geowoodstock."

I'm sure it wasn't intentional, or maybe that super wasp was responsible, but the magnet was actually stuck to the i-beam inside the black bumper! That's a really strong magnet! We tried using the Nuvi's cable to lasso it...then I used my pen...then I used my hand (hoping no wasps were inside) and was able to flip it and pull it to daylight. For a log that was replaced 5 months ago, it's dry and crisp! Thanks for the challenge! We replaced it in it's likely intended location!"

The rest of the day was quite delightful and the weather kept getting better and better before ending in Columbia, MO.

Little did I know that the counties she wanted to pick up were in Montana, South Dakota, Nebraska, Wyoming Colorado & Kansas. So much for a short day trip & getting a few things done around the house or a few days just for me! Ok, so it was really mostly my idea & she just agreed to tag along as long as I let her try to find all the caches she possibly could !Here's how it really went:I am off work & thought that since neither of us had ever been to North & South Dakota or Montana and she had never been to most of the other states out this way it would be fun to go caching out here. We left last Tuesday & are having a blast going places we have never been, seeing historic places & just places that are different & unusual. To make it even better we are finding all kinds of caches, meeting (unexpectedly) other cachers, trading bugs out, meeting & talking to people we have never met & will probably never meet again. This is what life is all about. I can hardly wait until I retire in another year or so. TN LN SL Thanks so much for making this trip fun with the cache you hid just for us to find!"

Really enjoyed the cemetery, the stones and ornaments around them and took several pics. We have never seen a medal of honor on a monument before and this one was from the Civil War, very cool.  Loved that huge old, unfortunately dead tree.  So glad we stopped in to break up the highway monotony, we really enjoyed this one. Thanks for placing quest4adventure.

Today I started in Ottumwa, IA with some foggy weather and got into some rather stormy conditions as I made my way into Missouri.  Eventually I punched through a line of thunderstorms while moving west from Edina to Kirksville.  The rest of the day was quite delightful and the weather kept getting better and better before ending in Columbia, MO.  Most of my good friends going to GWS were well on their way to the event and I had hoped to see some on the journey, but I wound up not crossing paths with anyone though I evidently crossed paths with some of my Maryland friends near Macon or Moberly today.  Lots of fun caches to be had today!\n\nI wasn't sure of the path to the cache at first, thinking it was private property.  But I took a chance and it led me right back to Martha and the cache.  A large bird lost a significant battle along the pathway by the barn, and most of its carcass was right there and feathers were all over the path for a span of about 150 feet.\n\nTook a moment to spot the cache, but it was in great shape!

Needless to say we stopped for the night in Kirksville, MO and decided to local cache in the snow and it turned out to be very fun!\n\nthis one required hiking through the snow and getting cold feet!

Yes, that would be the same day a snowstorm was predicted to blow through. Despite logic, our adventurous streak prevailed, and we left from Columbia, MO, early in the day to visit Ottumwa, IA, where November Ghost has family roots. Ottumwa is quite charming! I learned how delicious a canteen lunch is while overhearing the locals discussing the brewing snow. Still un-phased by the talk of ferocious flurries, we spent the afternoon finding many fine caches. Our trip included a visit to Ghost\u2019s past and a test of courage involving climbing up the slippery branches of a tree in the rain. You bet we exchanged some high fives after tackling that one. Around 5 or 6, it finally dawned on us that there was supposed to be some inclement weather on the way. Still, we dilly-dallied at a diner before finally getting out on the road as the sun was setting. Did I mention that I\u2019m from the south, and that I\u2019d never driven through snow before? November Ghost was behind the wheel\u2026 but that doesn\u2019t mean he could actually see the road. And neither could I. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been that terrified due to weather. Now I know what those bumps on the sides of the lane are for! Driving blind proved to be much too stressful, so we stopped in Kirksville, MO for the night (and I found my first cache in the snow!) We made it home safe and sound on Sunday morning, and with a hearty respect for Mother Nature. Many thanks to all of the cachers who placed the hides we found on our trip!\n\nSunday morning, I woke up to a lovely blanket of snow and took the geo-pibble for a walk in it. Turns out, she loves snow! After a morning meetup at the golden arches for coffee, November Ghost and I took the jeep out to make some fresh tracks through the field of white. Finding this cache took a few, but with frozen hands we signed the log. Thanks!"

Now I only have 5 to go, but they will have to wait.  Also, filled a couple more dates on the calendar and added a few more counties in north central Missouri to the map.  Drove over 700 miles through rain, snow and sun, but it was all worth it for the joy of more smilies!  Thanks to all the CO\u2019s for creating and maintaining these hides for my enjoyment, especially the old ones!  Cache on!\n\nAnother quick find, another MO county.  Thanks!!"

Yes, that would be the same day a snowstorm was predicted to blow through. Despite logic, our adventurous streak prevailed, and we left from Columbia, MO, early in the day to visit Ottumwa, IA, where November Ghost has family roots. Ottumwa is quite charming! I learned how delicious a canteen lunch is while overhearing the locals discussing the brewing snow. Still un-phased by the talk of ferocious flurries, we spent the afternoon finding many fine caches. Our trip included a visit to Ghost\u2019s past and a test of courage involving climbing up the slippery branches of a tree in the rain. You bet we exchanged some high fives after tackling that one. Around 5 or 6, it finally dawned on us that there was supposed to be some inclement weather on the way. Still, we dilly-dallied at a diner before finally getting out on the road as the sun was setting. Did I mention that I\u2019m from the south, and that I\u2019d never driven through snow before? November Ghost was behind the wheel\u2026 but that doesn\u2019t mean he could actually see the road. And neither could I. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been that terrified due to weather. Now I know what those bumps on the sides of the lane are for! Driving blind proved to be much too stressful, so we stopped in Kirksville, MO for the night (and I found my first cache in the snow!) We made it home safe and sound on Sunday morning, and with a hearty respect for Mother Nature. Many thanks to all of the cachers who placed the hides we found on our trip!\n\nSunday morning, I woke up to a lovely blanket of snow and took the geo-pibble for a walk in it. Turns out, she loves snow! After a morning meetup at the golden arches for coffee, November Ghost and I took the jeep out to make some fresh tracks through the field of white. This park-n-grab was a fun find today. Thanks!"
