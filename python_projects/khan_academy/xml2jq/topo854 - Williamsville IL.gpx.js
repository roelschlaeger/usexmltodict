I left a pencil in the cache.\nI remember Zenobia well.  Zenobia was a settlement located about 1/2 mile south of the cache location.  I was born and raised just a short distance south of there.  I remember as a young lad going to the old Zenobia store with my Grandfather.  The store closed in the late 1950s-early 1960s.  Several of the buildings, including the store, remained until 20-30 years ago .  Now there is 1 building left which may have been the blacksmith building and the kiln from the brick factory which was south of the Zenobia store about 1/4 mile.   1.5 miles south of the Zenobia store was the Zenobia Baptist Church which was active until 1994 when it was destroyed by arson.  The arsonists were never found.  All that remains now at the site of the church is a memorial marker.\nBit of a heads up tho.  If anyone wants to find this cache then I suggest you look for this soon before the rains start again.  This area floods about once a year, sometimes more often, depending on the rains and how saturated the ground is.  This area and the roads/structures were last underwater in November 2015 after 3\" of rain.  The ground was dry then and the creek had very little water.  Now the creek is about 1/2 full and the ground is saturated.  If we had gotten the 3\" of rain predicted in the last couple of days this would have been flooded again.  Storms predicted for next week.  I'll try to add a photo of the area after the November 2015 flooding.  The photo was taken after the water level had dropped about 2 feet.\nTFTC.\nWadcutter"

You can see from the placement on the map, GZ takes you to the middle of the road and the description of this cache doesn't describe that kind of hide\u2026 Well only being a couple of miles away I thought I'd give it a shot.  Took a little bit in the dark and being around 40 ft. off cords to the West, but we got it before the Rochester PD showed up wondering what I was doing in the timber.  tftc NateDawg\u2026. Next time you may want to walk off your cords from different directions to give a more accurate location.   That said... awesome job sir\u2026.Keep them coming FTF#234\n\n\nOri"

These larger containers really go missing in urban areas if they aren't completely out of site of muggles.  Great to hear that you plan to put out more caches Chompy!  You put them out and I'll get em.  tftc and FTF #237 for me.\n\n\nOri"

Women may or may not like these, but to be considered a real man, you need to have seen each of these movies (often several times). To meet the requirements, the movie has to have stood the test of time (be at least 10 years old) and be a great movie for guys (sorry ladies, but we don\u2019t always get into those \u201cromantic comedies\u201d). You can keep Hugh Grant, give me Mel Brooks or John Belushi any day!</p>\n<p>These will not be at the exact location, but will be somewhere nearby. To find it, you have to figure out the movie which will then give you the exact coordinates. Once you find it, you will need to provide your own writing instrument and log it. Finally, when you get home, you may have these lines stuck in your head and might feel an overwhelming urge to watch the move again (for the 142<sup>nd</sup> time).

If anything was wrong with any cache steph logged it so there isn't any need in me repeating it lol...I'm a lazy logger, it takes me sometimes a few months to log, she's a quick OCD type logger, she logs the same day or first thing the very next day lol...So she always beats me to the punch :)  TFTC!!!!"

It was a nice circle\u2026.Living out by the lake, I took a route so that this cache would be on the way back home.  This hide took a little bit to find.  (A  quick find when I put the GPS in the pocket and used GEO senses.)  My cords were reading into the water.  Well with the name of this cache, type of container, and D/T level it didn't pan out to be an underwater hide.  Use the GPS to get you to the point\u2026.Then put it away and logically look where this container might be.  Should be a quick find if you follow that advice\u2026.Thanks sbart71 for the fun.  Nice to see another active cacher in the Springfield area.  We need more.  tftc and FTF#245\n\n\nOri"

Thank your Aaron for adding to the Springfield area.\n\nTriple Take #2  FTF 04/25/16  6:30 am or so.  Next on the list was #2.  I don't recommend doing this one at night but not so bad with the lights on or early in the morning.  I had to really zero in before I made the grab. I checked multiple spot before I spotted a great place for a cache\u2026Yup, that be it.  Be Brave!  tftc and FTF#247\n\n\nOri"

Knowing X would be here in the morning, I thought if I wanted this, it would have to be a night time find.  Made my way to GZ and did a search.  Came up empty.  Looked at the D and T, I thought this may be too tough to do in the dark.  Almost gave up and decided to check one more spot.  Glad I did.  Not much on giving advice, but the D and T may be a bit high for this hide.  But we all roll different and I'm glad we do.  TFTC VJ42...and take a favorite point from me for your up and coming series.  Grabbed a trackable to move along.\n\nOri\n\nThis entry was edited by mrori11 on Monday, 17 March 2014 at 19:45:57 UTC."

I will be able to spot a magnetic key box from the underbelly of the bleachers... or 2. \u00a0I will have to run my hands down every inch of this thing to make the grab...and sometimes that doesn't even work. \u00a0Well my friends, Bleachers is not a typical hide....Many curveballs have been seen from these bleachers, but now your up to bat. \u00a0This geocache follows all the rules and can\u00a0be found at a reasonable distance from GZ.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Ori's Revenge series was placed in the Springfield area to highlight my LEAST favorite type of locations to hunt for a cache. \u00a0Why do you ask would I put out such a nasty series. \u00a0Well first of all, Springfield has already got plenty of P&amp;Gs and family friendly caches to choose from. \u00a0But I will have to say revenge is the main reason these are placed. \u00a0I have spent too many hours at locations like these. \u00a0Now it's my turn. \u00a0I will NOT be giving out ANY hints for these until it is found. \u00a0Even after the cache has been found, to get a hint, you must first log a DNF. Those are the rules. \u00a0Please respect all rules and laws of parks and parking when hunting. This series isn't for everyone... I personally would bring a pen and tweezers for these caches. \u00a0If you can't find it, that doesn't mean a \"requires maintence\" or \"needs archived\" should to be logged. \u00a0This series of caches is for the Geocacher who loves a challenge and the feeling of victory from a tough find....So if your ideal caching is a day filled with lamppost skirt lifting and going from telephone pole to telephone pole...You may not want to do these. \u00a0BUT MOST OF YOU WILL! \u00a0ENJOY or just ignore...LOL</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>"

If anything was wrong with any cache steph logged it so there isn't any need in me repeating it lol...I'm a lazy logger, it takes me sometimes a few months to log, she's a quick OCD type logger, she logs the same day or first thing the very next day lol...So she always beats me to the punch :)  TFTC!!!!\n\nSide note:  I was getting very close to 3000 caches, I had counted and made sure we went to this one to make it my 3000th find, I had planned a huge trip to Peoria to get my 3000th, but some personal issues made that not happen, so I figured what better cache to make my 3000th then a hard cache placed by a good friend, but then I plugged my GPS in to start logging caches and low and behold I had about 20 on there that I had forgotten to log from a while back, so this one wasn't my 3000th :( cache, my 3000th turned out to be some park and grab from cachers I don't know :( oh well i'll aim to make my 4000th a good one from you I hope :)"

We packed up Django with her stuff and set out a little before 7:00am on a three hour drive on interstates to our exit very near this cache.  This was our first stop.  We both already had this county, but I figured since we were driving right past this one, we might as well find it to add another county to our day.\n\nWe parked in the McDonald's parking lot, after I almost drive the wrong way through the drive thru.  We got out to discover it was hot out.  No AC in the outdoors.  The hint was perfect and I made the quick find.  Paycho signed us in as usual and I replaced.  On the way back to Django, Paycho noticed I was not wearing a trademark black shirt.  I knew with a heat index over 100 today, it would be wise to wear my cream colored Necco t-shirt.  I guess it helped, but it was a hot one today.  TFTC!"

Thanks it was fun to be the first to find for both of our teams, and even more fun knowing the cache had been there a year and no one had found it yet.

Didn't bother downloading this one to the GPS\u2026Just a close look at google maps and I was off.
