The oldest tree reported, from Missouri was 795 years old. The bark is reddish-brown, fibrous, and peels off in narrow strips. The leaves are of two types; sharp, spreading needle-like juvenile leaves 2.0\u20133.9\u00a0in long, and tightly adpressed scale-like adult leaves 0.079\u20130.16\u00a0in long.<br />\n<br />\nIt is a pioneer invader, which means that it is one of the first trees to repopulate cleared, eroded, or otherwise damaged land. It is unusually long lived among pioneer species, with the potential to live over 850 years.

Figuring another cache would be a bonus for people making the trek here, I hid an easy number bumper called \"Pinnacles Park & Grab\" at this site. It got a decent amount of finds, but it also got muggled a few times, too. I would dutifully replace the cache and keep on keeping on. \n\nCue the recent DNF's on this cache. Frankly getting tired of replacing it, I just archived the cache.\n\nImagine my surprise when I saw another cache in pretty much the same spot about a day later! It was also curious that it had a very similar name. Curious what the \"strong\" in the title meant, I emailed the cache owner. I told them that I was pleased to see the cache spot live on, but what does \"strong\" mean in this case?\n\nWell, I got an email back. It turns out that the current cache owner was going to ask to adopt my cache or at least maintain it, but the cache got archived before they could. Oh yeah, the \"strong\" part was explained as well, but you'll have to go get this cache to get the reasoning.\n\nWell, this brings me to today. I got to be a finder instead of an owner, today! I was out mushrooming and berry picking today, so I figured I'd make the drive up here to get the cache. I got to the cache area and parked. Following the obvious geo-trail, I got to ground zero and had cache in hand quickly.\n\nI signed the log, put everything back and scurried on back toward Columbia. Thanks for the cache, and thanks for keeping this spot going! TNLN/SL TFTC!"

I have a really good feeling as to why MSpry picked this spot for their cache and that makes me laugh and smile. Was there not a cache in this spot before??!! LOL !!!! hahahaha ....

Now I only have 5 to go, but they will have to wait.  Also, filled a couple more dates on the calendar and added a few more counties in north central Missouri to the map.  Drove over 700 miles through rain, snow and sun, but it was all worth it for the joy of more smilies!  Thanks to all the CO\u2019s for creating and maintaining these hides for my enjoyment, especially the old ones!  Cache on!\n\nQuick find on my way back to Iowa.  Thanks for adding another MO county.

From Columbia, we made a large northern and western loop, with our main goals being to visit the Slurpin\u2019 Soup and Watchin\u2019 Eagles geo-event, add a few new counties to my map, and cache around Hannibal. Our trip took us to an abandoned house, an old bridge in a ghost town, a frozen spring by an icy river, and a treacherous (okay, only slightly) jaunt in the Jeep by a creek bed. Overall, it was an awesome day \u2013 one of those that remind you why geocaching is so much fun.\n\nThis was our last find of the night, and we worked for it! I was almost ready to call it when I spotted the well-camouflaged cache. I traded out TBs after signing the log. Thanks for the cache!"

Eventually I punched through a line of thunderstorms while moving west from Edina to Kirksville.  The rest of the day was quite delightful and the weather kept getting better and better before ending in Columbia, MO.  Most of my good friends going to GWS were well on their way to the event and I had hoped to see some on the journey, but I wound up not crossing paths with anyone though I evidently crossed paths with some of my Maryland friends near Macon or Moberly today.  Lots of fun caches to be had today!\n\nAn animal appears to have crawled onto a mound near the cache and died.  It was in a rather visually disturbing state of decomposition as I walked past it.  I really didn't want to gawk out it - but it looked like either a small dog or dog-like creature.  [V]\n\nCache wasn't too difficult to retrieve.  TFTC."

The insane things we do for this hobby! Although tiring averaging over 800 miles/day, it was a truly amazing trip that colored in a lot of new territory on my map, brought me to some amazing places that I would never have gone to were it not for geocaching, and gave me plenty of time to reflect on life, family, and the beauty of the world in which we live. Special thanks to my amazing wife for allowing me to go off on this trip. Although she loves going with me when I geocache (most of the time) she was not interested in this kind of road trip LOL. I was able to move lots of trackables and find some great geocaches in the USA and Canada. Thanks to all the owners whose caches I chose to visit on my trip.\n\nKris\n\n13:06 27-Sep-2013 \n--Logged from Geocaching4Locus with my HTC EVO on the Sprint network."

Yes, that would be the same day a snowstorm was predicted to blow through. Despite logic, our adventurous streak prevailed, and we left from Columbia, MO, early in the day to visit Ottumwa, IA, where November Ghost has family roots. Ottumwa is quite charming! I learned how delicious a canteen lunch is while overhearing the locals discussing the brewing snow. Still un-phased by the talk of ferocious flurries, we spent the afternoon finding many fine caches. Our trip included a visit to Ghost\u2019s past and a test of courage involving climbing up the slippery branches of a tree in the rain. You bet we exchanged some high fives after tackling that one. Around 5 or 6, it finally dawned on us that there was supposed to be some inclement weather on the way. Still, we dilly-dallied at a diner before finally getting out on the road as the sun was setting. Did I mention that I\u2019m from the south, and that I\u2019d never driven through snow before? November Ghost was behind the wheel\u2026 but that doesn\u2019t mean he could actually see the road. And neither could I. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been that terrified due to weather. Now I know what those bumps on the sides of the lane are for! Driving blind proved to be much too stressful, so we stopped in Kirksville, MO for the night (and I found my first cache in the snow!) We made it home safe and sound on Sunday morning, and with a hearty respect for Mother Nature. Many thanks to all of the cachers who placed the hides we found on our trip!\n\nSunday morning, I woke up to a lovely blanket of snow and took the geo-pibble for a walk in it. Turns out, she loves snow! After a morning meetup at the golden arches for coffee, November Ghost and I took the jeep out to make some fresh tracks through the field of white. This was our last find of the trip. I feel we ended on a good one. I traded trackables. Thank you!"

Thanks again twilight rabbit.\n\n\nPart of my 4 day, 3,341 mile, 8 state, 3 province, $672 geocaching trip! The insane things we do for this hobby! Although tiring averaging over 800 miles/day, it was a truly amazing trip that colored in a lot of new territory on my map, brought me to some amazing places that I would never have gone to were it not for geocaching, and gave me plenty of time to reflect on life, family, and the beauty of the world in which we live. Special thanks to my amazing wife for allowing me to go off on this trip. Although she loves going with me when I geocache (most of the time) she was not interested in this kind of road trip LOL. I was able to move lots of trackables and find some great geocaches in the USA and Canada. Thanks to all the owners whose caches I chose to visit on my trip.\n\nKris\n\n\n13:20 27-Sep-2013 \n--Logged from Geocaching4Locus with my HTC EVO on the Sprint network."

Today I started in Ottumwa, IA with some foggy weather and got into some rather stormy conditions as I made my way into Missouri.  Eventually I punched through a line of thunderstorms while moving west from Edina to Kirksville.  The rest of the day was quite delightful and the weather kept getting better and better before ending in Columbia, MO.  Most of my good friends going to GWS were well on their way to the event and I had hoped to see some on the journey, but I wound up not crossing paths with anyone though I evidently crossed paths with some of my Maryland friends near Macon or Moberly today.  Lots of fun caches to be had today!\n\nIt's not much of a long drive - but this had a nice back-country road element leading up to this little hidden (yet not so hidden) spot.  Found quickly.  TFTC."

I have chosen the area because there is many areas you can park and still get to more than one cache by walking and then can get back into your vehicle and park again to get the next set of caches. You can also if you want walk or bike the nice trails in the area to get to most of the caches. There are also many things to do in the park, plan to bring the family and stay for more enjoyment after your cache adventure that will take you to many areas of the park including around the lake which will give you good views. If you do bring your kids please watch them when around vehicle used areas and the lake caches are not next to the water and you will have several feet if they get away from you. Most to all the cache should not take long to find depending on your expertise.V1p3rx and I have worked to make the series fun and not finding the same old thing over and over. You will find a couple different styles of hides and also one that is maybe not be the expected way to retrieve the cache from the rest of the series. Stealth may be required due to being close to trails, or areas people may visit. We have attempted to give you geocover in all areas but it is a park. Please make sure the cache is hidden well when you place it back into its hiding spot.

My journey around Mark Twain Lake had been a lot of fun and memorable.  Now all that remained was the drive home.  Knowing that there were some new caches in the Moberly area, I opted to take the longer route.\n\nArriving at the park, I was greeted by multi-colored lights announcing \"Season's Greetings\".  The entire park appeared to be lit up for the festivities!  How cool!  I parked close to the entrance and set upon the task at hand.  An initial miscalculation led to some backtracking.  Once at the coordinates, the cache was easily found, signed and replaced.  The theme immediately hit home, and I looked forward to discovering some familiar friends in the area.  [;)]"

It pinged again...and again...and AGAIN! All told, I saw eight caches pop up! \n\nThere was no way I was going to let them slide, so I messaged dphickey and asked him if he wanted to go on an epic FTF run with me. At first he said he couldn't go. I knew I was going anyway, so I told him I'd check as I got closer to Columbia. Sure enough, when I got close to town, he said he was able and ready to go! I picked him up and we took off north to Moberly!\n\nThis was the third cache of the evening. After suffing the sting of defeat on the previous cache, we set our sights on this one. We parked the car and walked toward the cache, seeing the probable hiding spot in the distance. Our suspicions were correct and we had cache in hand quickly. I put everything back and we headed back to the car. Just as we got back, I realized that I had left my flashlight at ground zero! Trudging back, I retrieved the flashlight and headed back to the car again. Off to the next cache!\n\nFTF-2 DNF-1\n\nThanks for the fun cache! TNLN/SL TFTC!\n\n-Fulton, MO"

It was right where you'd expect it to be\u2026 but we were busy looking in other places you'd expect it to be. Finally\u2026 it was found and we put our \"SLAGA 3\" signature on the log.

The Garment District was second only to New York City in number of clothing manufacturers in the 1930's. The Kansas City stockyards routed 2,631,808 cattle through its yards in 1923, in addition to hogs, mules and horses, making it second only the the Chicago yards in number of transactions. St Louis was founded in 1764 by Pierre Lacl\u00e8de Liguest and for many years was the center of trade for the states along the Mississippi and Missouri rivers. These two rivers have a combined basin of 689,000 square miles encompassing almost 42% of the land area of the coterminous United States. Missouri is also famous for it\u2019s Missouri Foxtrotters,(a fine mule) and it has been a major supplier of mules to the USA and foreign countries for over 150 years.<br />\n<br />\nMany famous people have called Missouri home including Jesse James,Daniel Boone, Harry Truman,George Washington Carver, Samuel Clemens, Laura Ingles Wilder, Maya Angelou,Satchel Paige, John \"Buck\" O\u2019Neil,J.C. Penny, Scott Joplin,General John J. Pershing, General Omar N. Bradley and my personal favorite Walter Elias Disney.<br />\n<br />\nAfter spending several months trying to find a place that best exemplified Missouri I decided that this site was the most fitting. Walt moved to Marceline at the age of four and this was very influential in his design of Disneyland. When he was designing Main Street USA he and his designers used the main street of Marceline as a model. Walt once said \"To tell the truth, more things of importance happened to me in Marceline than ever happened since--or are likely to in the future.\"<br />\n<br />\nThe cache is on private property but it is open to the public. There is parking due south of the cache that is very well marked. Also make sure you check the sign to the east of the parking lot in front of the house for more fun facts.<br />\n<br />\nPlease only do this cache during daylight hours as I have told the owner we would not be out after dark.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td height=\"61\" bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\">\n<p><strong>Logging Requirements:</strong> Enjoy this cache as you would any other.

I told the wife and kids that they could stay in the car if they want, but I'm going to make the trek back to go get it. It was a quick/easy find, but well hidden from Muggles. Since I didn't have my caching bag with me, I traded my favorite inkpen for the Cinderella Necklace. This cache is in such a historically magical place. Glad I had the idea to check my brain map."

Took the only one that was in the container and dropped off our Cache Across America #12 U.S. Flag Micro Geocoin and the another travel tag that wants to visit places where dreams take place (perfect location here!).

Oh no, did I come here in vain? Others had reported finding the cache quite a bit away from GZ, so I did the same and eventually found it. But the place where I found it was neither a good hiding spot, nor near GZ, and it didn't match the hint either. It must have been moved there by a muggle.

Always nice to see the off the beaten path stops.  I even managed to get eight icons on Saturday.  I am sure that will help me with a challenge somewhere along the route.  Thanks for the hospitality.  I was excited to see this one ended up on my route.  That sealed the deal for me.  I have been slowly collecting these.  It was a nice stroll out to Walt Disney's building.  I read the plaques and learned a little bit.  Only down side was one of the geodogs found something very disguisting to roll in.

So...here I drive, fighing off GIGANTIC Grasshoppers and wondering what in the world is making all that noise in the trees (it's quite in Nevada - - except the occasional Rattlesnake).  I was tickled pink when I drove up.  What a gorgeous area.  I had a couple of travel bugs ready to drop off.  I scurried through the beautiful area, glad that the family that was touring was about to leave. WHAT?  I can't find it?  NO WAY...I couldn't have drove that far and NOT find this cache!  Ok...I'll start searching photos.  Then I read the last log by DuneBuddy.  Hey, his picture doesn't match where I was.  My phone was taking me to the backside.  Once I looked at the photo, I too walked right up to the cache.  Got my number, stamped the log.  Discovered ONE travel bug inside and dropped off two.  The third one won't fit, so I'll save that one for the next cache.  I will post my photo when I get home and I'm not on my work computer [:)] Thank you for bringing me to such a fantastic place.

I also desperately messaged the CO to see if by chance I could get a response to my desperate call for help.

Thank you CO for this cache series .... We really enjoyed the places you picked... Especially surprised by the Michigan cache ... We would have never found McCourtys ( did I spell that right?) park on our own but loved it..... And the Bruneau Overlook in Idaho OMGOsh! We had been to the Bruneau Dunes before and we were really excited to find that overlook... A little hard on our travel van though.   And we loved camping at Atherton Creek in Wyoming after finding that cache! Thank you for all the fun ...

Now, I don't know about you, but to be able to head to a really great caching area to attend a Mega is a pretty awesome situation!\n\nSo, I made my plans. I knew I was going to drive across Missouri, up to Iowa and over to Nebraska, of course! So I planned...and planned...and planned. I plotted routes, I took caches into consideration. I decided to mainly focus on Earthcaches and Virtuals, but I certainly added others to the mix. If I was going to go on a road trip, I was going to make it fun!\n\nThis was day one of the adventure. It found me beginning at home in Fulton, caching my way along US 36 to St. Joseph and on up to Council Bluffs and finally the Omaha area. I had a lot of fun, that's for sure! My sights were originally set on stopping in St. Jo, but I got done with my route so quickly that I said to heck with it...I'd push on to Omaha!\n\nNaturally, along the way I did some caching, and boy was it fun!\n\nIf there were answers to be sent, they have been sent. Pics will be uploaded where necessary. [;)]\n\nThis cache was the 3rd cache of 69 caches on the day. Thanks for placing this cache for myself and others to enjoy!

The rest of the day was quite delightful and the weather kept getting better and better before ending in Columbia, MO.

Lots of fun caches to be had today!\n\nMy Nuvi had tried to route me via a rather interesting way to get to this cache, but gladly ignored it as it seemed a better way that didn't involve driving down mysterious non-existent roads and across airport runways was to be had.

Today I started in Ottumwa, IA with some foggy weather and got into some rather stormy conditions as I made my way into Missouri.  Eventually I punched through a line of thunderstorms while moving west from Edina to Kirksville.  The rest of the day was quite delightful and the weather kept getting better and better before ending in Columbia, MO.  Most of my good friends going to GWS were well on their way to the event and I had hoped to see some on the journey, but I wound up not crossing paths with anyone though I evidently crossed paths with some of my Maryland friends near Macon or Moberly today.  Lots of fun caches to be had today!\n\nThe Beta Band was playing on the radio as I rolled up on this cache.  I had great anticipation of seeing other cachers by about this point, but had not seen any.  The road was a little rough, but nothing my standard car couldn't handle.  Quick find.  TFTC."

I knew I was going to drive across Missouri, up to Iowa and over to Nebraska, of course! So I planned...and planned...and planned. I plotted routes, I took caches into consideration. I decided to mainly focus on Earthcaches and Virtuals, but I certainly added others to the mix. If I was going to go on a road trip, I was going to make it fun!\n\nThis was day one of the adventure. It found me beginning at home in Fulton, caching my way along US 36 to St. Joseph and on up to Council Bluffs and finally the Omaha area. I had a lot of fun, that's for sure! My sights were originally set on stopping in St. Jo, but I got done with my route so quickly that I said to heck with it...I'd push on to Omaha!\n\nNaturally, along the way I did some caching, and boy was it fun!\n\nIf there were answers to be sent, they have been sent.

I am happy to report I was successful.  Along the way I kept an eye out for ghost caches, high favorite points, and challenges.  I got a good tour of the KC metro area on this trip.  Always nice to see the off the beaten path stops.  I even managed to get eight icons on Saturday.  I am sure that will help me with a challenge somewhere along the route.  Thanks for the hospitality.  This one is going to be a memorable one.  I found the cache quick enough and was just getting ready to drive off when the cops showed up.  Apparently one of the patrons thought I had planted a bomb.  I explained geocaching to everyone and showed them what I was up to.  All is good now.  XNSL TFTC"

The bridge was built out of white pine using the Howe-truss system, utilizing vertical iron rods to draw the diagonal members tight against the top and bottom of the bridge.  It was situated on the main east-west road in northern Missouri, and served as a link over Locust Creek on America\u2019s first transcontinental road. (Route 8)  In 1930, U. S. Highway 36 replaced Route 8, and after World War II, Locust Creek was channelized and straightened, so that it no longer flowed under the bridge.  Years of floods filled in the old riverbed with silt, which is why it appears that it is spanning an empty field.  In 1991, the bridge was raised six feet  to give it once again the appearance of a bridge and to protect it from wet ground below.\n\nTo log this cache, please email me with a basic explanation as to where in the bridge the structures shown in the pictures are located.  i.e. inside or outside the bridge, on the walls going up and down, across the ceiling, underneath the bridge, etc."

I am happy to report I was successful.  Along the way I kept an eye out for ghost caches, high favorite points, and challenges.  I got a good tour of the KC metro area on this trip.  Always nice to see the off the beaten path stops.  I even managed to get eight icons on Saturday.  I am sure that will help me with a challenge somewhere along the route.

What's more... it had a \"24/7\" attribute attached to it... something rather important since it was like 10:00 at night by this point in our trip.\n\nSo we headed down the gravel roads... winding this way and that 'til we got to the parking area for the covered bridge area. And as we pulled into the parking lot... we saw a sign indicating that the hours of visiting the bridge ended at sundown... not quite the \"24/7\" we had been hoping for.\n\nI hope to get back here sometime when we can get to the bridge... but in the meantime... the cache page might should be updated to indicate that the cache isn't available 24/7.

We left Thursday morning at 4:15 from Colorado and arrived at the hotel in St. Lewis MO 20 hours later.  Caching along the way always seams to make the time go by faster, but also adds 6 hours to the trip.  \nWe only found 100 caches total including all the events.  Every one of the caches was special for some reason.  I picked up 35+ new counties, several virtuals, larges, Earth caches, letterboxes, and a couple wherigos we even found about 50 waymarks, some benchmarks and some labs caches.  Some highlights of the trip were seeing the arch, seeing a flash mob broken up by police, SWAG Dragon falling flat into a ditch full of stinky water, being at our first Geowoodstock, and exploring some of the rich local history.  I enjoyed seeing some fellow Colorado cachers 1000 miles away.  The answers for the VCs, and ECs are being sent by Joe Friday, OneKindWord or Egnix.  Let me know if I need to sort through the pics and notes and answer myself. We used a group stamp most of the time. Thank you for placing this cache and keeping it going.  I am glad it was a part of the overall experience of going on a road trip to Geowoodstock."

I knew I was going to drive across Missouri, up to Iowa and over to Nebraska, of course! So I planned...and planned...and planned. I plotted routes, I took caches into consideration. I decided to mainly focus on Earthcaches and Virtuals, but I certainly added others to the mix. If I was going to go on a road trip, I was going to make it fun!\n\nThis was day one of the adventure. It found me beginning at home in Fulton, caching my way along US 36 to St. Joseph and on up to Council Bluffs and finally the Omaha area. I had a lot of fun, that's for sure! My sights were originally set on stopping in St. Jo, but I got done with my route so quickly that I said to heck with it...I'd push on to Omaha!\n\nNaturally, along the way I did some caching, and boy was it fun!\n\nIf there were answers to be sent, they have been sent. Pics will be uploaded where necessary. [;)]\n\nThis cache was the 8th cache of 69 caches on the day. Thanks for placing this cache for myself and others to enjoy!

I knew I was going to try to cover a bunch of states...why not?! So I planned...and planned...and planned. I plotted routes, I took caches into consideration. I decided to mainly focus on Earthcaches and Virtuals, but I certainly added others to the mix. If I was going to go on a road trip of a lifetime, I was going to make it fun!\n\nDay One was more about getting miles under my belt than numbers of caches, so I only found a few along the way. \n\nIf there were answers to be sent, they have been sent.

Now, I don't know about you, but to be able to head to a really great caching area to attend a Mega is a pretty awesome situation!\n\nSo, I made my plans. I knew I was going to drive across Missouri, up to Iowa and over to Nebraska, of course! So I planned...and planned...and planned. I plotted routes, I took caches into consideration. I decided to mainly focus on Earthcaches and Virtuals, but I certainly added others to the mix. If I was going to go on a road trip, I was going to make it fun!\n\nThis was day one of the adventure. It found me beginning at home in Fulton, caching my way along US 36 to St. Joseph and on up to Council Bluffs and finally the Omaha area. I had a lot of fun, that's for sure! My sights were originally set on stopping in St. Jo, but I got done with my route so quickly that I said to heck with it...I'd push on to Omaha!\n\nNaturally, along the way I did some caching, and boy was it fun!\n\nIf there were answers to be sent, they have been sent. Pics will be uploaded where necessary. [;)]\n\nThis cache was the 6th cache of 69 caches on the day. Thanks for placing this cache for myself and others to enjoy!

I knew I was going to drive across Missouri, up to Iowa and over to Nebraska, of course! So I planned...and planned...and planned. I plotted routes, I took caches into consideration. I decided to mainly focus on Earthcaches and Virtuals, but I certainly added others to the mix. If I was going to go on a road trip, I was going to make it fun!\n\nThis was day one of the adventure. It found me beginning at home in Fulton, caching my way along US 36 to St. Joseph and on up to Council Bluffs and finally the Omaha area. I had a lot of fun, that's for sure! My sights were originally set on stopping in St. Jo, but I got done with my route so quickly that I said to heck with it...I'd push on to Omaha!\n\nNaturally, along the way I did some caching, and boy was it fun!\n\nIf there were answers to be sent, they have been sent. Pics will be uploaded where necessary. [;)]\n\nThis cache was the 7th cache of 69 caches on the day. Thanks for placing this cache for myself and others to enjoy!

Today I started in Ottumwa, IA with some foggy weather and got into some rather stormy conditions as I made my way into Missouri.  Eventually I punched through a line of thunderstorms while moving west from Edina to Kirksville.  The rest of the day was quite delightful and the weather kept getting better and better before ending in Columbia, MO.  Most of my good friends going to GWS were well on their way to the event and I had hoped to see some on the journey, but I wound up not crossing paths with anyone though I evidently crossed paths with some of my Maryland friends near Macon or Moberly today.  Lots of fun caches to be had today!\n\nAnother case of the Nuvi thinking the access for the cache was too close to the main highway.  Resorted to my own routing algorithm to get to the old highway and found it without too much difficulty.  Lots of muggles drove practically with me to the cache as they were trying to get to the last houses on the road."

Eventually I punched through a line of thunderstorms while moving west from Edina to Kirksville.  The rest of the day was quite delightful and the weather kept getting better and better before ending in Columbia, MO.  Most of my good friends going to GWS were well on their way to the event and I had hoped to see some on the journey, but I wound up not crossing paths with anyone though I evidently crossed paths with some of my Maryland friends near Macon or Moberly today.

We left Thursday morning at 4:15 from Colorado and arrived at the hotel in St. Lewis MO 20 hours later.  Caching along the way always seams to make the time go by faster, but also adds 6 hours to the trip.  \nWe only found 100 caches total including all the events.  Every one of the caches was special for some reason.  I picked up 35+ new counties, several virtuals, larges, Earth caches, letterboxes, and a couple wherigos we even found about 50 waymarks, some benchmarks and some labs caches.  Some highlights of the trip were seeing the arch, seeing a flash mob broken up by police, SWAG Dragon falling flat into a ditch full of stinky water, being at our first Geowoodstock, and exploring some of the rich local history.  I enjoyed seeing some fellow Colorado cachers 1000 miles away.  The answers for the VCs, and ECs are being sent by Joe Friday, OneKindWord or Egnix.  Let me know if I need to sort through the pics and notes and answer myself. We used a group stamp most of the time. Thank you for placing this cache and keeping it going.  I am glad it was a part of the overall experience of going on a road trip to Geowoodstock."

I agreed thinking that I could do a few things around the house later in the week & maybe have a couple days just for me the 2nd week. This was last Tuesday (7/8/14)! Little did I know that the counties she wanted to pick up were in Montana, South Dakota, Nebraska, Wyoming Colorado & Kansas. So much for a short day trip & getting a few things done around the house or a few days just for me! Ok, so it was really mostly my idea & she just agreed to tag along as long as I let her try to find all the caches she possibly could !Here's how it really went:I am off work & thought that since neither of us had ever been to North & South Dakota or Montana and she had never been to most of the other states out this way it would be fun to go caching out here. We left last Tuesday & are having a blast going places we have never been, seeing historic places & just places that are different & unusual. To make it even better we are finding all kinds of caches, meeting (unexpectedly) other cachers, trading bugs out, meeting & talking to people we have never met & will probably never meet again. This is what life is all about. I can hardly wait until I retire in another year or so. TN LN SL Thanks so much for making this trip fun with the cache you hid just for us to find!"

Eventually I punched through a line of thunderstorms while moving west from Edina to Kirksville.  The rest of the day was quite delightful and the weather kept getting better and better before ending in Columbia, MO.  Most of my good friends going to GWS were well on their way to the event and I had hoped to see some on the journey, but I wound up not crossing paths with anyone though I evidently crossed paths with some of my Maryland friends near Macon or Moberly today.  Lots of fun caches to be had today!\n\nI wasn't sure of the path to the cache at first, thinking it was private property.  But I took a chance and it led me right back to Martha and the cache.  A large bird lost a significant battle along the pathway by the barn, and most of its carcass was right there and feathers were all over the path for a span of about 150 feet.\n\nTook a moment to spot the cache, but it was in great shape!

I initially had to deal with some rain, but it all cleared up very quickly by the time I got to my first cache. I got a lot of caches today, to say the very least. No matter how many I got today, I had an awesome time just being outdoors and enjoying the weather. This was one of the ones I found, and it helped to create a great experience.\n\nThis cache was the 1st of 113 total caches on the day.

Levi Aldrich was architect and contractor. In February 1864 the court had appropriated $10,000 from the general fund and ordered that the money be raised by a special tax. After seeing the plan, they appropriated an additional $15,000. Costs ran to approximately $30,000. The county offices moved into the building in September 1865. An annex was added in 1895, costing about $8,500. Today, the 1865 courthouse is a rare example of architecture, representing this turbulent decade of Missouri's history.

We looked all around the tree at ground zero... but came up with nothing. We did several more circlings of the tree... looking up high and down low... but nothing was found. We started circling neighboring trees in the same manner... looking up and down with our flashlights. But still we found nothing.\n\nFinally... getting frustrated and near ready to give up and move on to another cache... I looked in a new location and just barely spotted the cache. After letting the GPS unit settled down... it indicated that the location of the cache was 36 feet west of ground zero.\n\nI took nothing... but left my signature on the log and one of my signature miniature, marbled dice in the container.

It is worrisome when a cache with a successful find history has a string of DNF's. The geocaching community would like to know how it's going here. Is your cache still here, its being worked on, that sort of thing. When you get a chance, please log onto your page and give everyone an update by posting a note to your cache page.\n\nI'm temporarily disabling it, to give you an opportunity to stop by and check on the cache.\n\nIf you decide that this project has reached it's end you can archive it to remove it from the active cache database.\n\nWhen everything is OK again, please remember to enable your cache and post an \"Owner Maintenance\" log on your cache page. This log removes the \"needs maintenance\" and allows your cache to be shown in the search results of Pocket Queries. Don't let your cache be filtered out unnecessarily in Pocket Queries by forgetting to re-set the attribute!\n\nI want to thank you for the time that you have taken to contribute to Geocaching in the past and I am looking forward to hopefully seeing your cache up and running in the near future.\n\nHOW TO RESPOND IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS\n\nRespond by posting a new Note. Go to the cache page in question, and click on Log Your Visit. Select \"Post Note\" as the log type, and enter your message. Doing that, I'll know exactly what cache your message pertains to, which will speed the communication process.\nIf you're reading this as an email, don't reply to the sending address. It won't reach me. Follow the contact instructions above.\nGlenn\n\"Seek quality, not quantity\".\n--\nYour friendly Missouri Geocache Review team is\nGlenn (*gln), Mongo & Banjo-Boy\n\n[size=1][beige]#4a1a1d2559cd5c982ad509e44d011b54[/beige][/size]"

We left before dawn and the plan was to return after sunset.  This was cache 12 for the day.\n  We searched GZ high and low and as we did so two city park pickup trucks drove into the park, one empty trash cans as the other drove slowly around with the driver staring at us like we were criminals up to no good.   That didn't phase us, we non-chalantly determined the cache was not there and then debated on whether to perform a maintainance by putting out a new container.  All three of us are not fond of doing throw downs but A&T were pretty sure we knew the spot and were doubly sure the container was missing.   I had an extra matchstick container in my kit that I have had for several years so I added a pill bag and a log sheet and A&T placed it in a good spot at GZ.  CO can check on this and confirm his container is missing.   Signed log team TAD. TFTC."

I\u2019ll keep the spinnerbaits under \u00bc oz. Color depends on water clarity. For muddy water, which is often the case after a spring rain, I\u2019ll choose bright colors like chartreuse or orange. If the water is stained, white is by far your most consistent color. For clear water, go with a clear skirt that has silver glitter, or choose a natural color like watermelon (dark green) or pumpkinseed (brown). You can add trailers to spinnerbaits in order to offer a little variety in color. For the blade design, I prefer a single colorado blade for cold water. It gives you the greatest amount of vibration possible. This is especially important if the water is stained or muddy. If the fish are very active, or if you need more flash, go to a colorado/willow tandem.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thank to the City of Macon mo for your approval placing this cache</p>"

I knew I was going to drive across Missouri, up to Iowa and over to Nebraska, of course! So I planned...and planned...and planned. I plotted routes, I took caches into consideration. I decided to mainly focus on Earthcaches and Virtuals, but I certainly added others to the mix. If I was going to go on a road trip, I was going to make it fun!\n\nThis was day one of the adventure. It found me beginning at home in Fulton, caching my way along US 36 to St. Joseph and on up to Council Bluffs and finally the Omaha area. I had a lot of fun, that's for sure! My sights were originally set on stopping in St. Jo, but I got done with my route so quickly that I said to heck with it...I'd push on to Omaha!\n\nNaturally, along the way I did some caching, and boy was it fun!\n\nIf there were answers to be sent, they have been sent.

Yes, that would be the same day a snowstorm was predicted to blow through. Despite logic, our adventurous streak prevailed, and we left from Columbia, MO, early in the day to visit Ottumwa, IA, where November Ghost has family roots. Ottumwa is quite charming! I learned how delicious a canteen lunch is while overhearing the locals discussing the brewing snow. Still un-phased by the talk of ferocious flurries, we spent the afternoon finding many fine caches. Our trip included a visit to Ghost\u2019s past and a test of courage involving climbing up the slippery branches of a tree in the rain. You bet we exchanged some high fives after tackling that one. Around 5 or 6, it finally dawned on us that there was supposed to be some inclement weather on the way. Still, we dilly-dallied at a diner before finally getting out on the road as the sun was setting. Did I mention that I\u2019m from the south, and that I\u2019d never driven through snow before? November Ghost was behind the wheel\u2026 but that doesn\u2019t mean he could actually see the road. And neither could I. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been that terrified due to weather. Now I know what those bumps on the sides of the lane are for! Driving blind proved to be much too stressful, so we stopped in Kirksville, MO for the night (and I found my first cache in the snow!) We made it home safe and sound on Sunday morning, and with a hearty respect for Mother Nature. Many thanks to all of the cachers who placed the hides we found on our trip!\n\nSunday morning, I woke up to a lovely blanket of snow and took the geo-pibble for a walk in it. Turns out, she loves snow! After a morning meetup at the golden arches for coffee, November Ghost and I took the jeep out to make some fresh tracks through the field of white. There was a lot of yellow snow around the tree. It looked as if a horde of dogs with full bladders had gathered there. Turns out it was stained water from the leaves. The geo-pibble romped in the snow some more while Ghost signed the log. Thanks for all the hides!"

It is worrisome when a cache with a successful find history has a string of DNF's. The geocaching community would like to know how it's going here. Is your cache still here, is it being worked on, that sort of thing. When you get a chance, please log onto your page and give everyone an update by posting a note to your cache page.\n\nIf it is not disabled already, I will temporarily disable your cache   to give you an opportunity to stop by and check on your cache.\n\nIf you haven't had time to check on it by my next check I'll go ahead and archive it then.\nIf you decide that this project has reached its end you can archive it now to remove it from the active cache database.\n\nWhen everything is OK again, please remember to enable your cache and post an \"Owner Maintenance\" log on your cache page. This log removes the \"needs maintenance\" and allows your cache to be shown in the search results of Pocket Queries. Don't let your cache be filtered out unnecessarily in Pocket Queries by forgetting to reset the attribute!\nI want to thank you for the time that you have taken to contribute to Geocaching in the past and I am looking forward to hopefully seeing your cache up and running in the near future.\n\nHOW TO RESPOND IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS\nRespond by posting a new Note. Go to the cache page in question, and click on Log Your Visit. Select \"Post Note\" as the log type, and enter your message. Doing that, I'll know exactly what cache your message pertains to, which will speed the communication process.\nIf you're reading this as an email, don't reply to the sending address. It won't reach me. Follow the contact instructions above.\n\n\n----\n***Thanks a MILLION, Glenn***\n***\"Seek quality, not quantity\"***\n--Your friendly Missouri Geocache Review team is:\n ***[*gln](http://www.geocaching.com/profile/?u=*gln), [Mongo](http://www.geocaching.com/profile/?u=Mongo) and [Banjo-Boy](http://www.geocaching.com/profile/?u=Banjo-Boy)***\n \n----\n\n\n{#a5b4ef3ed7a32c94a2c08d9617ed05c0}"

The memorial was indeed cool, and the site interesting to visit!  Locating the geocache at night was a tad difficult but not impossible.  With everything replaced as discovered, I lingered a bit and reflected on life while gazing up at the stars and Milky Way.  The night sky was amazingly clear and detailed this far from any metropolitan areas.

Then Arthur and Trillian texted me and I filled him in on my plans.   We modified our plans for him to join me and grab the caches he needed.    Finally we arrived at the last cache in the park I had not found.  We made our way down the access road and onto ground zero.  I spotted the telltale tree right off.   Logged the cache and we headed off to another park so A&T could log the last of the Peanuts caches he needed.  TFTC!"

Well, I figured I was way too far away to even have a possibility to get them, so I reverently passed on them.\n\nFast forward to today. I was making my rounds on the internet when I checked the geocaching website and lo and behold, the caches were not found yet! What the heck, I figured...let's go for them!\n\nSo, I packed up my stuff and took off. In no time, I was there. I got to ground zero just fine and found the container. I had an idea what I was looking for, and my hunch paid off. Nice placement!\n\nThanks for the fun cache! TNLN/SL TFTC!\n\n-Fulton, MO"

You can also if you want walk or bike the nice trails in the area to get to most of the caches. There are also many things to do in the park, plan to bring the family and stay for more enjoyment after your cache adventure that will take you to many areas of the park including around the lake which will give you good views. If you do bring your kids please watch them when around vehicle used areas and the lake caches are not next to the water and you will have several feet if they get away from you. Most to all the cache should not take long to find depending on your expertise.V1p3rx and I have worked to make the series fun and not finding the same old thing over and over. You will find a couple different styles of hides and also one that is maybe not be the expected way to retrieve the cache from the rest of the series. Stealth may be required due to being close to trails, or areas people may visit. We have attempted to give you geocover in all areas but it is a park. Please make sure the cache is hidden well when you place it back into its hiding spot. There is a archery range in the area so use caution even though caches are not placed in the area of the archery. Hope you enjoy the area and caches available in the park and this series. \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Charles (Sparky) Monroe Schulz was born on November 22nd, 1922 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, but grow up in St. Paul Minnesota at the age of 77 he passed away on February 12<sup>th</sup>, 2000 in Santa Rosa, California.

It pinged again...and again...and AGAIN! All told, I saw eight caches pop up!\n\nThere was no way I was going to let them slide, so I messaged dphickey and asked him if he wanted to go on an epic FTF run with me. At first he said he couldn't go. I knew I was going anyway, so I told him I'd check as I got closer to Columbia. Sure enough, when I got close to town, he said he was able and ready to go! I picked him up and we took off north to Moberly!\n\nThis was the fourth cache of the evening. I pulled into the park, only to see the gates closed and locked. Looking at the cache page, it said that the park closed at 11 p.m., so we went for it, leaving the car parked at the gate. We walked to the appointed area and I immediately beaded onto a likely spot. Searching high and low yielded nothing until I glanced at another nearby tree where this was hidden. Bingo.\n\nFTF-3 DNF-1\n\nThanks for the fun cache! TNLN/SL TFTC!\n\n-Fulton, MO"

You can also if you want walk or bike the nice trails in the area to get to most of the caches. There are also many things to do in the park, plan to bring the family and stay for more enjoyment after your cache adventure that will take you to many areas of the park including around the lake which will give you good views. If you do bring your kids please watch them when around vehicle used areas and the lake caches are not next to the water and you will have several feet if they get away from you. Most to all the cache should not take long to find depending on your expertise.V1p3rx and I have worked to make the series fun and not finding the same old thing over and over. You will find a couple different styles of hides and also one that is maybe not be the expected way to retrieve the cache from the rest of the series. Stealth may be required due to being close to trails, or areas people may visit. We have attempted to give you geocover in all areas but it is a park. Please make sure the cache is hidden well when you place it back into its hiding spot. There is a archery range in the area so use caution even though caches are not placed in the area of the archery. Hope you enjoy the area and caches available in the park and this series. \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Charles (Sparky) Monroe Schulz was born on November 22nd, 1922 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, but grow up in St. Paul Minnesota at the age of 77 he passed away on February 12<sup>th</sup>, 2000 in Santa Rosa, California. Schulz first comic strip was called <em>Li\u2019l Folks and ran from June 1947-January 1950 in the</em> St. Paul Pioneer Press. In Li\u2019l Folks was the first time Schulz used the name Charlie Brown and he created a dog that also looked much like Snoopy. In May of 1948 Schulz sold the first of his one panel drawing to The Saturday Evening Post. After his Li\u2019l Folks comic strip was dropped in the 1950\u2019s, Schulz went to United Feature Syndicated with the one panel Li\u2019I Folks.

Peanuts made its debut on October 2<sup>nd</sup>, 1950, in seven different newspapers. The popular weekly Sunday page made its first appearance on January 6<sup>th</sup>, 1952. When the Peanuts comic strip was on top, it was published every day in 2,600 papers in 75 countries, 21 languages. In almost 50 years the Peanuts comic strip was produced Schulz drew nearly 18,000 strips. Between the comic strips, merchandise, product endorsement produced revenues of more than 1 billion per year. Schulz\u2019s estimated earrings was 30-40 million annually. The Peanuts comic strip only once why Schulz was alive have reshowings when Schulz went on vacation for five-weeks to celebrate his 75<sup>th</sup> birthday. Schulz never had assistants creating the strip and refused to hire an inker or letterer. On December 14<sup>th</sup> 1999 Schulz announced his retirement due to having several small strokes and a blocked aorta. It was later discovered he had colon cancer that had metastasized. Once Schulz started chemotherapy he was unable to see clearly. Schulz on February 12<sup>th</sup>, 2000 died in his sleep around 9:45 P.M. from colon cancer.

Then Arthur and Trillian texted me and I filled him in on my plans.   We modified our plans for him to join me and grab the caches he needed.    We decided to go after the FTF first.  We made our way up 63 then to the park.   We parked in a familiar area only this time in daylight.   We quickly made our way across the railroad and into the woods.   A&T spotted the cache and after a breif wait for the retreival we had a fresh virgin log.   CO-FTF for us.   After signing in we moved on to the next cache to revenge a DNF.  TFTC!"

We parked in a very similar spot where we got another FTF a week or so ago, and took off toward the cache. The walk was nice and easy and in no time we were at ground zero. Cache was in hand very quickly, and we were delighted to find a blank log! We happily scribbled out FTF initials, put everything back as it was, and took off toward the next cache.\n\nThanks for the fun cache! TNLN/SL TFTC!\n\n-Fulton, MO"

I have chosen the area because there is many areas you can park and still get to more than one cache by walking and then can get back into your vehicle and park again to get the next set of caches. You can also if you want walk or bike the nice trails in the area to get to most of the caches. There are also many things to do in the park, plan to bring the family and stay for more enjoyment after your cache adventure that will take you to many areas of the park including around the lake which will give you good views. If you do bring your kids please watch them when around vehicle used areas and the lake caches are not next to the water and you will have several feet if they get away from you. Most to all the cache should not take long to find depending on your expertise.V1p3rx and I have worked to make the series fun and not finding the same old thing over and over. You will find a couple different styles of hides and also one that is maybe not be the expected way to retrieve the cache from the rest of the series. Stealth may be required due to being close to trails, or areas people may visit. We have attempted to give you geocover in all areas but it is a park. Please make sure the cache is hidden well when you place it back into its hiding spot. There is a archery range in the area so use caution even though caches are not placed in the area of the archery. Hope you enjoy the area and caches available in the park and this series. \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Charles (Sparky) Monroe Schulz was born on November 22nd, 1922 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, but grow up in St. Paul Minnesota at the age of 77 he passed away on February 12<sup>th</sup>, 2000 in Santa Rosa, California.

It's amazing how much changes in just a few years; I remember this area simply being a field with some sparse trees!  Soon, leaving the path was necessary for finding the cache.  The hide was discovered with little difficulty but required a bit of a stretch to reach.  With the log signed, I returned to the car.\n\nThere were three other hides just on the other side of the Christmas light display.  Hmmm . . . how would I get over there?  Soon, I was in line for the light show to scope out potential approaches (and to enjoy the drive).  Who knew that Moberly had a moose crossing or that Santa drove a tractor?  [:P]  It was a nicely put together and enjoyable event.\n\nComing to the end, I parked and decided to dare walking across the show to the caches.  I darted into the shadows whenever a car approached and soon entered the woods.  A disc golf course pathway was followed but only to a point.  The telltale yips and barks of several coyote caught my attention.  Nope!  There was no way I would risk running into a pack of coyote for a cache.  Those on the other side of the light show would have to wait until another day."

It pinged again...and again...and AGAIN! All told, I saw eight caches pop up!\n\nThere was no way I was going to let them slide, so I messaged dphickey and asked him if he wanted to go on an epic FTF run with me. At first he said he couldn't go. I knew I was going anyway, so I told him I'd check as I got closer to Columbia. Sure enough, when I got close to town, he said he was able and ready to go! I picked him up and we took off north to Moberly!\n\nThis was the sixth cache of the evening. We arrived at the location for this cache and walked cheerily to ground zero.

You can also if you want walk or bike the nice trails in the area to get to most of the caches. There are also many things to do in the park, plan to bring the family and stay for more enjoyment after your cache adventure that will take you to many areas of the park including around the lake which will give you good views. If you do bring your kids please watch them when around vehicle used areas and the lake caches are not next to the water and you will have several feet if they get away from you. Most to all the cache should not take long to find depending on your expertise.V1p3rx and I have worked to make the series fun and not finding the same old thing over and over. You will find a couple different styles of hides and also one that is maybe not be the expected way to retrieve the cache from the rest of the series. Stealth may be required due to being close to trails, or areas people may visit. We have attempted to give you geocover in all areas but it is a park. Please make sure the cache is hidden well when you place it back into its hiding spot. There is a archery range in the area so use caution even though caches are not placed in the area of the archery. Hope you enjoy the area and caches available in the park and this series. \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Charles (Sparky) Monroe Schulz was born on November 22nd, 1922 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, but grow up in St. Paul Minnesota at the age of 77 he passed away on February 12<sup>th</sup>, 2000 in Santa Rosa, California.

It pinged again...and again...and AGAIN! All told, I saw eight caches pop up!\n\nThere was no way I was going to let them slide, so I messaged dphickey and asked him if he wanted to go on an epic FTF run with me. At first he said he couldn't go. I knew I was going anyway, so I told him I'd check as I got closer to Columbia. Sure enough, when I got close to town, he said he was able and ready to go! I picked him up and we took off north to Moberly!\n\nThis was the eighth and final cache of the evening. We arrived at the best location I could find to park and set off into the woods. We walked to and fro and about halfway into the trip, the batteries on my GPSr died! Oh well...here comes the phone! Not my favorite way, but you gotta do what you gotta do. Anyway, we made the journey just fine and found the final pristine log.\n\nFTF-6 DNF-2\n\nThanks for the fun cache! TNLN/SL TFTC!\n\n-Fulton, MO"

Then things got tougher as the road veered off and we bushwhacked into the woods at around  .1 mile from the cache.   The closer we got the more I ran into sticker bushes and low hanging branches....   I don't recommend being crazy like some certain cachers who did this at night.   But it's December and I didn't run into any spider webs or pick up any ticks and we were geocaching... so all was good.   Once we got withing 20 feet we saw what we thought would be the spot and sure enough there was stoic piano player with the clean log that we got to put the first signatures on.   All in all a great series and I will definitely return for the 2 DNFS and the 2 or 3 of the other caches in the series that were published earlier.  TFTC!"

I have chosen the area because there is many areas you can park and still get to more than one cache by walking and then can get back into your vehicle and park again to get the next set of caches. You can also if you want walk or bike the nice trails in the area to get to most of the caches. There are also many things to do in the park, plan to bring the family and stay for more enjoyment after your cache adventure that will take you to many areas of the park including around the lake which will give you good views. If you do bring your kids please watch them when around vehicle used areas and the lake caches are not next to the water and you will have several feet if they get away from you. Most to all the cache should not take long to find depending on your expertise.V1p3rx and I have worked to make the series fun and not finding the same old thing over and over. You will find a couple different styles of hides and also one that is maybe not be the expected way to retrieve the cache from the rest of the series. Stealth may be required due to being close to trails, or areas people may visit. We have attempted to give you geocover in all areas but it is a park. Please make sure the cache is hidden well when you place it back into its hiding spot. There is a archery range in the area so use caution even though caches are not placed in the area of the archery. Hope you enjoy the area and caches available in the park and this series. \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Charles (Sparky) Monroe Schulz was born on November 22nd, 1922 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, but grow up in St. Paul Minnesota at the age of 77 he passed away on February 12<sup>th</sup>, 2000 in Santa Rosa, California.

Pig Pen was most often seen in dirty overalls with a cloud of dust and dirt following him everywhere he goes. Pig Pen refers to the dust and dirt as the dust of ancient civilizations. Despite not being able to stay clean Charlie Brown accepts him for who he is and defends his uncleanliness in one comic strip and then again in A Charlie Brown Christmas. Pig Pen began being seen on T.V. Specials in the 1960\u2019s, and in all four movies.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"line-height:1.6;\">When Geocaching please respect and follow the rules of the park.</span></p>\n<p>The Park is open to the public daily from 5:00 a.m.-11:00 p.m.</p>\n<p>Do not damage any of the parks property, tress, or other wildlife.</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy the park and its amenities.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Congratulations to Arthur &amp; Trillian &amp; dphicky on Co- FTF</p>"

I hurriedly looked to see where it was, and wouldn't you know it? It was in the place I was in very recently...Moberly! Well, not long after, my email pinged again. Another in Moberly! It pinged again...and again...and AGAIN! All told, I saw eight caches pop up!\n\nThere was no way I was going to let them slide, so I messaged dphickey and asked him if he wanted to go on an epic FTF run with me. At first he said he couldn't go. I knew I was going anyway, so I told him I'd check as I got closer to Columbia. Sure enough, when I got close to town, he said he was able and ready to go! I picked him up and we took off north to Moberly!\n\nThis was the seventh cache of the evening. We arrived at the location for this cache and walked cheerily to ground zero. Discussion about the namesake character ensued. One of the easiest caches of the day, it's location was obvious and we made quick work of it. \n\nFTF-5 DNF-2\n\nThanks for the fun cache!

I have chosen the area because there is many areas you can park and still get to more than one cache by walking and then can get back into your vehicle and park again to get the next set of caches. You can also if you want walk or bike the nice trails in the area to get to most of the caches. There are also many things to do in the park, plan to bring the family and stay for more enjoyment after your cache adventure that will take you to many areas of the park including around the lake which will give you good views. If you do bring your kids please watch them when around vehicle used areas and the lake caches are not next to the water and you will have several feet if they get away from you. Most to all the cache should not take long to find depending on your expertise.V1p3rx and I have worked to make the series fun and not finding the same old thing over and over. You will find a couple different styles of hides and also one that is maybe not be the expected way to retrieve the cache from the rest of the series. Stealth may be required due to being close to trails, or areas people may visit. We have attempted to give you geocover in all areas but it is a park. Please make sure the cache is hidden well when you place it back into its hiding spot. There is a archery range in the area so use caution even though caches are not placed in the area of the archery. Hope you enjoy the area and caches available in the park and this series. \u00a0</p>\n<p>Charles (Sparky) Monroe Schulz was born on November 22nd, 1922 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, but grow up in St. Paul Minnesota at the age of 77 he passed away on February 12<sup>th</sup>, 2000 in Santa Rosa, California.

It pinged again...and again...and AGAIN! All told, I saw eight caches pop up! \n\nThere was no way I was going to let them slide, so I messaged dphickey and asked him if he wanted to go on an epic FTF run with me. At first he said he couldn't go. I knew I was going anyway, so I told him I'd check as I got closer to Columbia. Sure enough, when I got close to town, he said he was able and ready to go! I picked him up and we took off north to Moberly!\n\nThis was the first cache of the evening. We parked at the dog park lot and walked to the area the cache was in. After a little tree dodging, the cache was found. Opening it up, we were greeted by a pristine log! One problem, though...neither of us brought an implement to sully the log with out initials! Well, dphickey went back and got a pen and all was saved!\n\nFTF - 1\n\nThanks for the fun cache! TNLN/SL TFTC!\n\n-Fulton, MO"

A&T said he'd pick me up if I went out for the FTF with him.  Well the wife was still late so I said go without out me and continued making dinner.  When the wife finally got home, dinner was ready and once I completed dinner I got a message saying A&T was in COMO and wanted to know if I still couldn't go.   Well no excuse now, I was rushing around getting ready for caching in the dark.  Once he picked me up I worked quickly to enter the new cache coords into my old trusty 60CSX from my phone as we raced up 63.  This was the first cache we attempted.  We parked near the dog park and made our way to ground zero in the dark, and A&T made the quick find only to be foiled by him leaving his pen in the car and me leaving mine in my GPS case that I left on the picnic table near the car when I tied my shoes.  Easy enough solution, I made my way back to the table and retrieved my case and pen and we sign the log A&T and DPH.   Thanks for the new cache."

I have chosen the area because there is many areas you can park and still get to more than one cache by walking and then can get back into your vehicle and park again to get the next set of caches. You can also if you want walk or bike the nice trails in the area to get to most of the caches. There are also many things to do in the park, plan to bring the family and stay for more enjoyment after your cache adventure that will take you to many areas of the park including around the lake which will give you good views. If you do bring your kids please watch them when around vehicle used areas and the lake caches are not next to the water and you will have several feet if they get away from you. Most to all the cache should not take long to find depending on your expertise.V1p3rx and I have worked to make the series fun and not finding the same old thing over and over. You will find a couple different styles of hides and also one that is maybe not be the expected way to retrieve the cache from the rest of the series. Stealth may be required due to being close to trails, or areas people may visit. We have attempted to give you geocover in all areas but it is a park. Please make sure the cache is hidden well when you place it back into its hiding spot. There is a archery range in the area so use caution even though caches are not placed in the area of the archery. Hope you enjoy the area and caches available in the park and this series.\n<p>Charles (Sparky) Monroe Schulz was born on November 22nd, 1922 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, but grow up in St. Paul Minnesota at the age of 77 he passed away on February 12<sup>th</sup>, 2000 in Santa Rosa, California.

I logged on to Geocaching.com and browsed around and noticed that there was a cache in Moberly that had not been found yet.   FTF run?   Why not.  Asked the wife if she wanted to go for a drive and after completing a few errands we were off.  After getting FTF on another cache in this series I decided to run over to this park and grab some of the series I didn't get on a previous trip as well as rectify a few DNFs.   I picked this one as it was closest.   The wife again stayed in the car as I made my search.   Cache was spotted quickly and I had to push my way into the spot to reach it.   Signed the log and returned to the car only to have my wife tell me I smelled like cat pee.   One thing about the tree that was at GZ, they tend to smell....  TFTC"

New, it's not safe to check them while driving, so at the first convenient spot, I looked to see what was up. Two new caches in Moberly! Well, I figured I was way too far away to even have a possibility to get them, so I reverently passed on them.\n\nFast forward to today. I was making my rounds on the internet when I checked the geocaching website and lo and behold, the caches were not found yet! What the heck, I figured...let's go for them!\n\nSo, I packed up my stuff and took off. In no time, I was there. I got to ground zero just fine and found the container. Finding it was no issue...retrieving it was. I am mildly allergic to the host spot. No matter, though...I got it!\n\nThanks for the fun cache! TNLN/SL TFTC!\n\n-Fulton, MO"

You can also if you want walk or bike the nice trails in the area to get to most of the caches. There are also many things to do in the park, plan to bring the family and stay for more enjoyment after your cache adventure that will take you to many areas of the park including around the lake which will give you good views. If you do bring your kids please watch them when around vehicle used areas and the lake caches are not next to the water and you will have several feet if they get away from you. Most to all the cache should not take long to find depending on your expertise.V1p3rx and I have worked to make the series fun and not finding the same old thing over and over. You will find a couple different styles of hides and also one that is maybe not be the expected way to retrieve the cache from the rest of the series. Stealth may be required due to being close to trails, or areas people may visit. We have attempted to give you geocover in all areas but it is a park. Please make sure the cache is hidden well when you place it back into its hiding spot. There is a archery range in the area so use caution even though caches are not placed in the area of the archery. Hope you enjoy the area and caches available in the park and this series. \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Charles (Sparky) Monroe Schulz was born on November 22nd, 1922 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, but grow up in St. Paul Minnesota at the age of 77 he passed away on February 12<sup>th</sup>, 2000 in Santa Rosa, California.

So today, with nothing better to do, I decided to run to Moberly and find all the caches I have not found yet in the series and not in the series.  Then Arthur and Trillian texted me and I filled him in on my plans.   We modified our plans for him to join me and grab the caches he needed.    After the FTF find, we both wanted to revenge the DNF we had on this on our last FTF trip.   After pulling up and parking A&T started to read Unitzoid's FTF log.  One line in the log made me think that the cache was not in the area we searched before and I immediately started looking for areas that fit the other hides in the series.  Bingo, I spotted it from about 15 feet away.   A quick read of the GPS showed it was about 60 feet off from the posted coords.  I signed the log as A&T took a reading to share for future finders.

He wanted to avenge some DNF's, find some new caches and go for a FTF! Well, we teamed up to go accomplish these very goals. I needed a couple he had and he needed a couple I had, so with mutual goals, we set off!\n\nThis was one of the DNF's that we both needed to avenge. We got to the same parking area we went to last time and prepared to engage in a long hunt. I was barely out of the vehicle, ready to get to business, when all of a sudden dphickey announced he had found it! So quickly? Yes he did! It's like he channeled the cache owner's knowledge. No matter...we signed the log, happy to have avenged the DNF we had earlier.\n\nWe noticed the cache was about 60-65 feet away from where ground zero was, so we took a new set of coordinates. They may not be exact, but they will bring you a lot closer to where  the cache will be.\n\nThanks for the fun cache! TNLN/SL TFTC!\n\n-Fulton, MO"

Considerable time was spent poking, prodding and gently moving around bits of debris.  Finally, a sneaky idea came to mind, and the GPS was ignored entirely.

At first he said he couldn't go. I knew I was going anyway, so I told him I'd check as I got closer to Columbia. Sure enough, when I got close to town, he said he was able and ready to go! I picked him up and we took off north to Moberly!\n\nThis was the fifth cache of the evening. We arrived at the location for this cache and began the search. We searched and we searched.

I have chosen the area because there is many areas you can park and still get to more than one cache by walking and then can get back into your vehicle and park again to get the next set of caches. You can also if you want walk or bike the nice trails in the area to get to most of the caches. There are also many things to do in the park, plan to bring the family and stay for more enjoyment after your cache adventure that will take you to many areas of the park including around the lake which will give you good views. If you do bring your kids please watch them when around vehicle used areas and the lake caches are not next to the water and you will have several feet if they get away from you. Most to all the cache should not take long to find depending on your expertise.V1p3rx and I have worked to make the series fun and not finding the same old thing over and over. You will find a couple different styles of hides and also one that is maybe not be the expected way to retrieve the cache from the rest of the series. Stealth may be required due to being close to trails, or areas people may visit. We have attempted to give you geocover in all areas but it is a park. Please make sure the cache is hidden well when you place it back into its hiding spot. There is a archery range in the area so use caution even though caches are not placed in the area of the archery. Hope you enjoy the area and caches available in the park and this series. \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Charles (Sparky) Monroe Schulz was born on November 22nd, 1922 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, but grow up in St. Paul Minnesota at the age of 77 he passed away on February 12<sup>th</sup>, 2000 in Santa Rosa, California.

He wanted to avenge some DNF's, find some new caches and go for a FTF! Well, we teamed up to go accomplish these very goals. I needed a couple he had and he needed a couple I had, so with mutual goals, we set off!\n\nThis was one of the DNF's that I needed to avenge. It seemed that dphickey had already found this one, so it was up to me to complete the avenging process for the group. We got to the same parking area we went to last time and I prepared for a hunt. Armed with a better set of coordinates, I found the cache with no problems! I signed the log, happy to have avenged the DNF!\n\nThe cache is a bit distant from the posted numbers, so here are the coordinates I used to find the cache.

I logged on to Geocaching.com and browsed around and noticed that there was a cache in Moberly that had not been found yet.   FTF run?   Why not.  Asked the wife if she wanted to go for a drive and after completing a few errands we were off.  After FTF and a find on two other caches in this series I decided to attempt to revenge the DNF I had on a previous visit.   The rain was steady by light and there was much more light than my previous visit but that didn't help much.   GPS pointed me right back to the spot I was in the previous night.   So I did the search as before, expanded it a bit, checked the hint, started over and searched more, expanded even farther...   Finally I decided it was time for a PAF.   Drat the phone number of my source was deleted when my phone had that hiccup....  Searching previous call logs rectified the situation, and the information that the coords may be a bit off was given.  Given new data I focused my search and sure enough the cache was found.  Retrieving it took a bit of work, and a madeshift TOTT that I fashioned out of some debris nearby and cache was in hand and signed.   Replacing the cache took a bit of work but once done all was good and ready for the finder.   This was the last of the day as once again it was getting dark and the other DNF nearby had a muggle parked right at GZ doing who knows what..   Decided to call it a day.   TFTC"

The GPS was mostly ignored as the coordinates pointed to a spot that probably wouldn't conceal a geocache well.  A couple of circles around eventually brought about another bit of inspiration.  A-ha!  There the cache was!  Retrieving it was a fairly interesting process.  Very nice!  With the log signed and all returned as found, I walked back to the car.  The GPS indicated that further caching awaited.  However, after the amount of hiking earlier (and the potential encounter with coyote), I opted to call the day complete."

All told, I saw eight caches pop up! \n\nThere was no way I was going to let them slide, so I messaged dphickey and asked him if he wanted to go on an epic FTF run with me. At first he said he couldn't go. I knew I was going anyway, so I told him I'd check as I got closer to Columbia. Sure enough, when I got close to town, he said he was able and ready to go! I picked him up and we took off north to Moberly!\n\nThis was the second cache of the evening. We had a good idea where the cache should have been...that much is certain. Fate, however, decided to play with us. Our GPSr's bouncing between three trees, we couldn't quite get a lock on things. I searched what I felt was the likely spot, but came up with nothing. I like night caching, but caching in the dark adds difficulty to the search, sometimes making an easy hide a lot harder. Oh well...better luck next time!\n\nFTF-1 DNF-1\n\nThanks for the fun cache!

There are also many things to do in the park, plan to bring the family and stay for more enjoyment after your cache adventure that will take you to many areas of the park including around the lake which will give you good views. If you do bring your kids please watch them when around vehicle used areas and the lake caches are not next to the water and you will have several feet if they get away from you. Most to all the cache should not take long to find depending on your expertise.V1p3rx and I have worked to make the series fun and not finding the same old thing over and over. You will find a couple different styles of hides and also one that is maybe not be the expected way to retrieve the cache from the rest of the series. Stealth may be required due to being close to trails, or areas people may visit. We have attempted to give you geocover in all areas but it is a park. Please make sure the cache is hidden well when you place it back into its hiding spot. There is a archery range in the area so use caution even though caches are not placed in the area of the archery. Hope you enjoy the area and caches available in the park and this series. \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Charles (Sparky) Monroe Schulz was born on November 22nd, 1922 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, but grow up in St. Paul Minnesota at the age of 77 he passed away on February 12<sup>th</sup>, 2000 in Santa Rosa, California.

Asked the wife if she wanted to go for a drive and after completing a few errands we were off.   She relaxed with a book in the car on the way to Moberly and I planned on a few caches after getting a FTF.   Once we arrived at the park we admred the pretty scenery and then I put the rain coat on and made my way across the bridge.  I noticed a pretty little waterfall, took some pictures and then made my way to GZ.   After arriving at GZ I spotted the cache right off, but the approach was not clear.   How to reach the cache without getting completely soaked?  Finally I just dived in and pushed through to find a blank log... awesome FTF.   Signed the log, replaced the cache and made my way back to the car.  TFTC"

Yes, that would be the same day a snowstorm was predicted to blow through. Despite logic, our adventurous streak prevailed, and we left from Columbia, MO, early in the day to visit Ottumwa, IA, where November Ghost has family roots. Ottumwa is quite charming! I learned how delicious a canteen lunch is while overhearing the locals discussing the brewing snow. Still un-phased by the talk of ferocious flurries, we spent the afternoon finding many fine caches. Our trip included a visit to Ghost\u2019s past and a test of courage involving climbing up the slippery branches of a tree in the rain. You bet we exchanged some high fives after tackling that one. Around 5 or 6, it finally dawned on us that there was supposed to be some inclement weather on the way. Still, we dilly-dallied at a diner before finally getting out on the road as the sun was setting. Did I mention that I\u2019m from the south, and that I\u2019d never driven through snow before? November Ghost was behind the wheel\u2026 but that doesn\u2019t mean he could actually see the road. And neither could I. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been that terrified due to weather. Now I know what those bumps on the sides of the lane are for! Driving blind proved to be much too stressful, so we stopped in Kirksville, MO for the night (and I found my first cache in the snow!) We made it home safe and sound on Sunday morning, and with a hearty respect for Mother Nature. Many thanks to all of the cachers who placed the hides we found on our trip!\n\nSunday morning, I woke up to a lovely blanket of snow and took the geo-pibble for a walk in it. Turns out, she loves snow! After a morning meetup at the golden arches for coffee, November Ghost and I took the jeep out to make some fresh tracks through the field of white. We found this cache with ease, signed the log, and continued on our way home. Thanks for the smiley!"

Today I started in Ottumwa, IA with some foggy weather and got into some rather stormy conditions as I made my way into Missouri.  Eventually I punched through a line of thunderstorms while moving west from Edina to Kirksville.  The rest of the day was quite delightful and the weather kept getting better and better before ending in Columbia, MO.  Most of my good friends going to GWS were well on their way to the event and I had hoped to see some on the journey, but I wound up not crossing paths with anyone though I evidently crossed paths with some of my Maryland friends near Macon or Moberly today.  Lots of fun caches to be had today!\n\nTypical P&G style of cache.  Not a whole lot happening in the immediate vicinity during my mid-afternoon visit."

Our Veterans Foreign Wars (VFW), American Veterans (AmVets), American Legion, and Vinton's Vol. Fire Dept., all get together for this Parade..

It is worrisome when a cache with a successful find history has a string of DNF's. The geocaching community would like to know how it's going here. Is your cache still here, is it being worked on, that sort of thing. When you get a chance, please log onto your page and give everyone an update by posting a note to your cache page.\n\nIf it is not disabled already, I will temporarily disable your cache   to give you an opportunity to stop by and check on your cache.\n\nIf you haven't had time to check on it by my next check I'll go ahead and archive it then.\nIf you decide that this project has reached its end you can archive it now to remove it from the active cache database.\n\nWhen everything is OK again, please remember to enable your cache and post an \"Owner Maintenance\" log on your cache page. This log removes the \"needs maintenance\" and allows your cache to be shown in the search results of Pocket Queries. Don't let your cache be filtered out unnecessarily in Pocket Queries by forgetting to reset the attribute!\nI want to thank you for the time that you have taken to contribute to Geocaching in the past and I am looking forward to hopefully seeing your cache up and running in the near future.\n\nHOW TO RESPOND IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS\nRespond by posting a new Note. Go to the cache page in question, and click on Log Your Visit. Select \"Post Note\" as the log type, and enter your message. Doing that, I'll know exactly what cache your message pertains to, which will speed the communication process.\nIf you're reading this as an email, don't reply to the sending address. It won't reach me. Follow the contact instructions above.\n\n\n----\n***Thanks a MILLION, Glenn***\n***\"Seek quality, not quantity\"***\n--Your friendly Missouri Geocache Review team is:\n ***[*gln](http://www.geocaching.com/profile/?u=*gln), [Mongo](http://www.geocaching.com/profile/?u=Mongo) and [Banjo-Boy](http://www.geocaching.com/profile/?u=Banjo-Boy)***\n \n----\n\n\n{#9ddb5344ab12c87d822207f045e268c2}"

Yes, that would be the same day a snowstorm was predicted to blow through. Despite logic, our adventurous streak prevailed, and we left from Columbia, MO, early in the day to visit Ottumwa, IA, where November Ghost has family roots. Ottumwa is quite charming! I learned how delicious a canteen lunch is while overhearing the locals discussing the brewing snow. Still un-phased by the talk of ferocious flurries, we spent the afternoon finding many fine caches. Our trip included a visit to Ghost\u2019s past and a test of courage involving climbing up the slippery branches of a tree in the rain. You bet we exchanged some high fives after tackling that one. Around 5 or 6, it finally dawned on us that there was supposed to be some inclement weather on the way. Still, we dilly-dallied at a diner before finally getting out on the road as the sun was setting. Did I mention that I\u2019m from the south, and that I\u2019d never driven through snow before? November Ghost was behind the wheel\u2026 but that doesn\u2019t mean he could actually see the road. And neither could I. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been that terrified due to weather. Now I know what those bumps on the sides of the lane are for! Driving blind proved to be much too stressful, so we stopped in Kirksville, MO for the night (and I found my first cache in the snow!) We made it home safe and sound on Sunday morning, and with a hearty respect for Mother Nature. Many thanks to all of the cachers who placed the hides we found on our trip!\n\nSunday morning, I woke up to a lovely blanket of snow and took the geo-pibble for a walk in it. Turns out, she loves snow! After a morning meetup at the golden arches for coffee, November Ghost and I took the jeep out to make some fresh tracks through the field of white. There was a backpack on the ground near the cache. And some plastic grocery bags filled with brown lumps. Yeah... thanks for the smiley anyway!"

Which he did.\u00a0 Reassembly was performed later by Dad.\u00a0 He liked to see how things worked and had an aptitude for mechanical and electrical work.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>John enjoyed sports and excelled as a Junior Bowler and attended State tournaments with his friends on Rancho Bowl teams.\u00a0 After he grew up and left home he almost always had two bowling balls in the trunk of his car, in case a bowling opportunity materialized.\u00a0 He took up throwing the Discus in High School and in his Senior year he went to the California Southern Section CIF finals to qualify for the state tournament and missed qualifying by one slot, they took 9 throwers and John finished 10<sup>th</sup> with his best throw of the season.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>John was a great person and devoted to his friends and family.\u00a0 He was not lucky in love.\u00a0 He wanted the dream, but the women he chose did not. He stayed for 5 years with the first love and finally ended it with no children.\u00a0 He then married a woman with 3 children and was happy to act as their father for 9 years.\u00a0 Kayla, Alexis and Kenneth (Bubba) Smart were very much loved by John, and were placed with their biological Dad after his second divorce.\u00a0 However he did get full custody of his children from that marriage , Emily and Matthew.\u00a0 His greatest joy was the successes of all 5 of the children and he enjoyed sharing their stories.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>John joined the Army in May of 1999, not wanting to go to college at the time, but looking for training he could use in life, plus the benefits of college subsidies he could use later.\u00a0 He went to a 9 month Medical Equipment Course and was the honor graduate.\u00a0 Because of his ability to assimilate and retain information, he was able to not only utilize his high school education to advance him in his class, but also to tutored others who were struggling.\u00a0 John was sent to Kuwait and then into Iraq as a part of the invasion force in 2003.\u00a0 He left the Army with an honorable discharge in May 2005, because he did not want to be separated from his family in the future.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>John then moved his family from his last Military duty station in San Antonio, TX to Columbia, MO, where he worked for Modern Biomedical Services, Inc. in support of the Moberly Regional Medical Center (MRMC).\u00a0 He was a Bio-Medical Technician there, repairing and maintaining medical equipment within the hospital complex.\u00a0 He loved his job and the people he worked with both within Modern Biomedical and MRMC.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The friends he met through work and outside work, in his community, were important to him and he was always willing and able to lend a helping hand when needed.\u00a0 He loved to coach discus and found a small school that could use his help.\u00a0 He also helped coach his children's teams as they began playing</p>\n<p>sports.\u00a0 He was active in helping his children succeed in school and placed a heavy emphasis on the importance of school in them.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>While the help he provided to others was part of his legacy, their help in working him through the rough parts of his life was also\u00a0 important. The people that knew him always describe him as happy and cheerful to all.\u00a0 He was moving his life into a better place after his last divorce and his positive attitude was shining through.\u00a0 It was a tragedy when a drunk driver, going the wrong way on a divided highway, ended his young life on 11 March 2014.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>John made the world around him a better place while he was here and no one can ask more than that.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>"

Today I started in Ottumwa, IA with some foggy weather and got into some rather stormy conditions as I made my way into Missouri.  Eventually I punched through a line of thunderstorms while moving west from Edina to Kirksville.  The rest of the day was quite delightful and the weather kept getting better and better before ending in Columbia, MO.  Most of my good friends going to GWS were well on their way to the event and I had hoped to see some on the journey, but I wound up not crossing paths with anyone though I evidently crossed paths with some of my Maryland friends near Macon or Moberly today.  Lots of fun caches to be had today!\n\nVery nice hide, and sorry for your loss.  John was only a few months older than myself and read your memorial on the cache page.

Needless to say we stopped for the night in Kirksville, MO and decided to local cache in the snow and it turned out to be very fun!\n\nthis one required hiking through the snow and getting cold feet!

Yes, that would be the same day a snowstorm was predicted to blow through. Despite logic, our adventurous streak prevailed, and we left from Columbia, MO, early in the day to visit Ottumwa, IA, where November Ghost has family roots. Ottumwa is quite charming! I learned how delicious a canteen lunch is while overhearing the locals discussing the brewing snow. Still un-phased by the talk of ferocious flurries, we spent the afternoon finding many fine caches. Our trip included a visit to Ghost\u2019s past and a test of courage involving climbing up the slippery branches of a tree in the rain. You bet we exchanged some high fives after tackling that one. Around 5 or 6, it finally dawned on us that there was supposed to be some inclement weather on the way. Still, we dilly-dallied at a diner before finally getting out on the road as the sun was setting. Did I mention that I\u2019m from the south, and that I\u2019d never driven through snow before? November Ghost was behind the wheel\u2026 but that doesn\u2019t mean he could actually see the road. And neither could I. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been that terrified due to weather. Now I know what those bumps on the sides of the lane are for! Driving blind proved to be much too stressful, so we stopped in Kirksville, MO for the night (and I found my first cache in the snow!) We made it home safe and sound on Sunday morning, and with a hearty respect for Mother Nature. Many thanks to all of the cachers who placed the hides we found on our trip!\n\nSunday morning, I woke up to a lovely blanket of snow and took the geo-pibble for a walk in it. Turns out, she loves snow! After a morning meetup at the golden arches for coffee, November Ghost and I took the jeep out to make some fresh tracks through the field of white. Finding this cache took a few, but with frozen hands we signed the log. Thanks!"

Now I only have 5 to go, but they will have to wait.  Also, filled a couple more dates on the calendar and added a few more counties in north central Missouri to the map.  Drove over 700 miles through rain, snow and sun, but it was all worth it for the joy of more smilies!  Thanks to all the CO\u2019s for creating and maintaining these hides for my enjoyment, especially the old ones!  Cache on!\n\nAnother quick find, another MO county.  Thanks!!"

Yes, that would be the same day a snowstorm was predicted to blow through. Despite logic, our adventurous streak prevailed, and we left from Columbia, MO, early in the day to visit Ottumwa, IA, where November Ghost has family roots. Ottumwa is quite charming! I learned how delicious a canteen lunch is while overhearing the locals discussing the brewing snow. Still un-phased by the talk of ferocious flurries, we spent the afternoon finding many fine caches. Our trip included a visit to Ghost\u2019s past and a test of courage involving climbing up the slippery branches of a tree in the rain. You bet we exchanged some high fives after tackling that one. Around 5 or 6, it finally dawned on us that there was supposed to be some inclement weather on the way. Still, we dilly-dallied at a diner before finally getting out on the road as the sun was setting. Did I mention that I\u2019m from the south, and that I\u2019d never driven through snow before? November Ghost was behind the wheel\u2026 but that doesn\u2019t mean he could actually see the road. And neither could I. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been that terrified due to weather. Now I know what those bumps on the sides of the lane are for! Driving blind proved to be much too stressful, so we stopped in Kirksville, MO for the night (and I found my first cache in the snow!) We made it home safe and sound on Sunday morning, and with a hearty respect for Mother Nature. Many thanks to all of the cachers who placed the hides we found on our trip!\n\nSunday morning, I woke up to a lovely blanket of snow and took the geo-pibble for a walk in it. Turns out, she loves snow! After a morning meetup at the golden arches for coffee, November Ghost and I took the jeep out to make some fresh tracks through the field of white. This park-n-grab was a fun find today. Thanks!"

Today I started in Ottumwa, IA with some foggy weather and got into some rather stormy conditions as I made my way into Missouri.  Eventually I punched through a line of thunderstorms while moving west from Edina to Kirksville.  The rest of the day was quite delightful and the weather kept getting better and better before ending in Columbia, MO.  Most of my good friends going to GWS were well on their way to the event and I had hoped to see some on the journey, but I wound up not crossing paths with anyone though I evidently crossed paths with some of my Maryland friends near Macon or Moberly today.  Lots of fun caches to be had today!\n\nNice bold hide!  Rarely see one hidden so \"open\" as this.  I enjoyed it and think it deserves a FP."

It was yet another day that required fulfillment for the geocaching challenge, and all prior attempts took me either west or south.  A new cache in Moberly prompted the change in compass direction.  Parking was easily found nearby; however, ice on the pavement brought forth caution.  Approaching the coordinates, a sizable tree stump was admired.  This must have been one large tree in its day!  The cache was spotted soon thereafter and quickly retrieved.  A new signature was added to the log book, and the container was replaced as found with a little bit of additional geocover.  Thanks for an interesting hide!\n\nTook nothing, left nothing."

It was very firmly iced into its spot!\n\nI made several trips to my car, trying various objects to scrape off or dislodge ice and cache. In the end, it was my trusty walking stick that levered it out! You know the quote, \"Give me a lever and a place to stand and I shall move the world.\" Which is what I did. \n\nI took the cache to a nearby table to sign. I took the candy, not a good cache item! And left one of the tools that is useful, just not for ice removal.\n\nThanks for the {*FTF*} and the really cool stump! When things thaw out, this might need better cover. If I were a kid, that location would be a playground!\n\nThis entry was edited by fearlessknits on Thursday, 06 March 2014 at 01:58:20 UTC."
