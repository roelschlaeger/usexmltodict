I had solved all but the final of this from home just from the pictures, but somehow, I lost my notes, so I started from scratch in the field today.  The first stage was no problem at all, either finding or reading.  It was then off two stage two.  Stage two was no problem to find, but was a little hard to read.  It could be made out, but barely, and I was soon on my way to stage three.  Stage three was a bit hard to spot, but once spotted, easy to read, and it was off to stage four.  Stage four shouldn't have been a problem to find, but it took me a few minutes before I spotted the container.  Once in hand, a quick photo was taken, and I was on my way to the final.  I parked WAY too far from the final, but as I was walking around, trying to look nonchalant, like I'm just taking tricorder readings or something, I think I may have seen HoneyBeeMawMaw looking at me as she made her way to her abode.  At that time, I didn't yet know where the cache was, although I was almost right on top of it.  A few moments later, and I had the \"Duh\" moment, signed the log, and recorded the TBs in the cache.

This particular arrival would be slightly different:  a multi-cache of some renown would be pursued.  Timing was essential as storm clouds were beginning to roll in.  I set upon the first stage and found it toot-sweet.  Armed with new coordinates, the second and third were swiftly approached and dispatched.  The fourth was where the challenge lay!  Some determined sleuthing was needed.  Eventually, feeling around brought forth the container with the final set of coordinates.  Huzzah!\n\nDriving to the final location, I parked and was immediately greeted by a friendly cat.  Also greeting me were the occupants of a nearby house.  Introductions were given and my activity explained.  With their blessings, I set forth to discovered the cache container.  My name and a brief log entry were added to the logbook.  Swapping trackables, I returned to the car and contemplated where to go next.\n\nThank you for this wonderfully put together multi-cache!  It provided a great tour of Auxvasse and reminded me why I got into this crazy, but fun, sport.  [:D]\n\nTook \"My Heart\" TB, left skating hedgehog TB."

First stop, we had never been here before, 2nd stop, low and behold this is right across the street from my sister's house so we knew the area well. 3rd stop this one took some time it blended in so well. Hint: Just stop and look for white.  4th stop, this one  took us quite a while to locate. It started raining and we used the gazebo for shelter to wait it out. Finally, after getting drenched we resorted to PAF, yep, we admit it, but we got it and off to the final.  As we circled 'round, someone spotted us from the front window, out stepped the CO, \"busted\" I said.  \"Haha\".  Great set up, we enjoyed even after getting wet from the much needed rained.  Difficulty rating probably should be raised to at least a 1.5 maybe even 2. Sign caused us some problems as well as the gazebo, we don't think either one are walk ups.  \nThanks PawPawGreybeard for the multi, we're using it for the 7 souvenirs of August. Nice talking with you on the porch this afternoon. Thanks for trading swag."

It took a minute of thinking to find the right road to the art, but I prevailed and found what I needed there. Those numbers led me to the park. This was the toughest stage for me. I looked a few minutes before I saw what I was looking for. You certainly have to think of all possibilities. \n\nArmed with the numbers to the final, I took off to that location. I arrived there and all was still. Not a creature stirring. A quick search found the final container and yes...I was elated to find that clean log book! I signed that bad boy, took the FTF prize (Thank you very much for it, by the way!) and the trackable and set off for home.\n\nThis was a very well done multi cache.

He thought it fell [b]just[/b] inside of Audrain County\u2026 but suggested I check before I rely on his memory since it was so close to the line. I never got around to checking\u2026 but decided to give it a shot anyway. So I got off of I-70 and headed up highway 54 to ground zero. After pulling into the cut-over road between the north and southbound lanes\u2026 I hopped out of my car and found the cache in the first place I looked (after waiting for the passing traffic to clear). I signed the log and dropped in one of my signature miniature, marbled dice. Then I waited for all the traffic to pass again and put the cache back where I found it.

Packing away my chair, I heard a loud PING! \n\nNew email! \n\nLemme just go check it out. A new cache, eh? No wait...not just one...not even two. Three new ones!Hmmmm...they are up in my hometown of Mexico! Daylight is starting to fade, but just maybe I might be able to go get them! So, after some convincing of Trillian to let me go, punctuated with a promise of a gift of chocolate to her, she allowed me to go. I dropped Trillian and Young Zaphod off at home and took off toward Mexico.\n\nAfter finishing the second cache, I went for this, the final cache of the evening. I got to the area just fine and, per the typical style I had experienced, I went to the spot and had cache in hand. Opening it up, I found yet another clean log sheet. Signing that FTF spot completed my FTF hat trick for the evening. I put everything back and headed for home, quite satisfied with this little cache run. Thanks for the series!\n\nYou get a favorite point for the awesome historical aspect of the cache. Thanks for placing this cache for everyone, myself included, to enjoy.

[:D]\n\nTrillian and I were at Fulton High School, wrapping things up after Young Zaphod and his fellow Hornets had concluded their tennis meet up with the Boonville Pirates. Packing away my chair, I heard a loud PING! \n\nNew email! \n\nLemme just go check it out. A new cache, eh? No wait...not just one...not even two. Three new ones!Hmmmm...they are up in my hometown of Mexico! Daylight is starting to fade, but just maybe I might be able to go get them! So, after some convincing of Trillian to let me go, punctuated with a promise of a gift of chocolate to her, she allowed me to go. I dropped Trillian and Young Zaphod off at home and took off toward Mexico.\n\nI went after this one first, simply because it was at a cemetery and daylight was starting to leave. I got to the area in time for it to be somewhat light out and before I even stopped the geo-mobile, I had an idea where it was. I hopped out of the car and quickly had cache in hand. Opening it up, I was greeted with a pristine log! Yay! I happily signed the FTF spot, put everything back as it was and headed off to the next cache.\n\nYou get a favorite point for the awesome historical aspect of the cache. Thanks for placing this cache for everyone, myself included, to enjoy. TNLN/SL\n\nYes, we know where our towels are...\n\n-Fulton, MO"

Three new ones!Hmmmm...they are up in my hometown of Mexico! Daylight is starting to fade, but just maybe I might be able to go get them! So, after some convincing of Trillian to let me go, punctuated with a promise of a gift of chocolate to her, she allowed me to go. I dropped Trillian and Young Zaphod off at home and took off toward Mexico.\n\nThis one was next on my agenda. I drove over from the cemetery and once I got to the area, the site of the marker was illuminated quite brightly. Sensing a theme possibly, I parked the geo-mobile, left the GPSr in the car and went over to the area of the marker to search. I found the cache quickly, Opened it up and found another blank log! I sullied this one up with my FTF signature, put everything back and made my way to the final cache of the evening.\n\nYou get a favorite point for the awesome historical aspect of the cache.

Which he did.\u00a0 Reassembly was performed later by Dad.\u00a0 He liked to see how things worked and had an aptitude for mechanical and electrical work.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>John enjoyed sports and excelled as a Junior Bowler and attended State tournaments with his friends on Rancho Bowl teams.\u00a0 After he grew up and left home he almost always had two bowling balls in the trunk of his car, in case a bowling opportunity materialized.\u00a0 He took up throwing the Discus in High School and in his Senior year he went to the California Southern Section CIF finals to qualify for the state tournament and missed qualifying by one slot, they took 9 throwers and John finished 10<sup>th</sup> with his best throw of the season.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>John was a great person and devoted to his friends and family.\u00a0 He was not lucky in love.\u00a0 He wanted the dream, but the women he chose did not. He stayed for 5 years with the first love and finally ended it with no children.\u00a0 He then married a woman with 3 children and was happy to act as their father for 9 years.\u00a0 Kayla, Alexis and Kenneth (Bubba) Smart were very much loved by John, and were placed with their biological Dad after his second divorce.\u00a0 However he did get full custody of his children from that marriage , Emily and Matthew.\u00a0 His greatest joy was the successes of all 5 of the children and he enjoyed sharing their stories.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>John joined the Army in May of 1999, not wanting to go to college at the time, but looking for training he could use in life, plus the benefits of college subsidies he could use later.\u00a0 He went to a 9 month Medical Equipment Course and was the honor graduate.\u00a0 Because of his ability to assimilate and retain information, he was able to not only utilize his high school education to advance him in his class, but also to tutored others who were struggling.\u00a0 John was sent to Kuwait and then into Iraq as a part of the invasion force in 2003.\u00a0 He left the Army with an honorable discharge in May 2005, because he did not want to be separated from his family in the future.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>John then moved his family from his last Military duty station in San Antonio, TX to Columbia, MO, where he worked for Modern Biomedical Services, Inc. in support of the Moberly Regional Medical Center (MRMC).\u00a0 He was a Bio-Medical Technician there, repairing and maintaining medical equipment within the hospital complex.\u00a0 He loved his job and the people he worked with both within Modern Biomedical and MRMC.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The friends he met through work and outside work, in his community, were important to him and he was always willing and able to lend a helping hand when needed.\u00a0 He loved to coach discus and found a small school that could use his help.\u00a0 He also helped coach his children's teams as they began playing</p>\n<p>sports.\u00a0 He was active in helping his children succeed in school and placed a heavy emphasis on the importance of school in them.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>While the help he provided to others was part of his legacy, their help in working him through the rough parts of his life was also\u00a0 important. The people that knew him always describe him as happy and cheerful to all.\u00a0 He was moving his life into a better place after his last divorce and his positive attitude was shining through.\u00a0 It was a tragedy when a drunk driver, going the wrong way on a divided highway, ended his young life on 11 March 2014.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>John made the world around him a better place while he was here and no one can ask more than that.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>"

Today I started in Ottumwa, IA with some foggy weather and got into some rather stormy conditions as I made my way into Missouri.  Eventually I punched through a line of thunderstorms while moving west from Edina to Kirksville.  The rest of the day was quite delightful and the weather kept getting better and better before ending in Columbia, MO.  Most of my good friends going to GWS were well on their way to the event and I had hoped to see some on the journey, but I wound up not crossing paths with anyone though I evidently crossed paths with some of my Maryland friends near Macon or Moberly today.  Lots of fun caches to be had today!\n\nVery nice hide, and sorry for your loss.  John was only a few months older than myself and read your memorial on the cache page.  He sounds liek a nice guy and a great loss to the community.  Thank you to John for his service."

It is worrisome when a cache with a successful find history has a string of DNF's. The geocaching community would like to know how it's going here. Is your cache still here, is it being worked on, that sort of thing. When you get a chance, please log onto your page and give everyone an update by posting a note to your cache page.\n\nIf it is not disabled already, I will temporarily disable your cache   to give you an opportunity to stop by and check on your cache.\n\nIf you haven't had time to check on it by my next check I'll go ahead and archive it then.\nIf you decide that this project has reached its end you can archive it now to remove it from the active cache database.\n\nWhen everything is OK again, please remember to enable your cache and post an \"Owner Maintenance\" log on your cache page. This log removes the \"needs maintenance\" and allows your cache to be shown in the search results of Pocket Queries. Don't let your cache be filtered out unnecessarily in Pocket Queries by forgetting to reset the attribute!\nI want to thank you for the time that you have taken to contribute to Geocaching in the past and I am looking forward to hopefully seeing your cache up and running in the near future.\n\nHOW TO RESPOND IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS\nRespond by posting a new Note. Go to the cache page in question, and click on Log Your Visit. Select \"Post Note\" as the log type, and enter your message. Doing that, I'll know exactly what cache your message pertains to, which will speed the communication process.\nIf you're reading this as an email, don't reply to the sending address. It won't reach me. Follow the contact instructions above.\n\n\n----\n***Thanks a MILLION, Glenn***\n***\"Seek quality, not quantity\"***\n--Your friendly Missouri Geocache Review team is:\n ***[*gln](http://www.geocaching.com/profile/?u=*gln), [Mongo](http://www.geocaching.com/profile/?u=Mongo) and [Banjo-Boy](http://www.geocaching.com/profile/?u=Banjo-Boy)***\n \n----\n\n\n{#9ddb5344ab12c87d822207f045e268c2}"

Yes, that would be the same day a snowstorm was predicted to blow through. Despite logic, our adventurous streak prevailed, and we left from Columbia, MO, early in the day to visit Ottumwa, IA, where November Ghost has family roots. Ottumwa is quite charming! I learned how delicious a canteen lunch is while overhearing the locals discussing the brewing snow. Still un-phased by the talk of ferocious flurries, we spent the afternoon finding many fine caches. Our trip included a visit to Ghost\u2019s past and a test of courage involving climbing up the slippery branches of a tree in the rain. You bet we exchanged some high fives after tackling that one. Around 5 or 6, it finally dawned on us that there was supposed to be some inclement weather on the way. Still, we dilly-dallied at a diner before finally getting out on the road as the sun was setting. Did I mention that I\u2019m from the south, and that I\u2019d never driven through snow before? November Ghost was behind the wheel\u2026 but that doesn\u2019t mean he could actually see the road. And neither could I. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been that terrified due to weather. Now I know what those bumps on the sides of the lane are for! Driving blind proved to be much too stressful, so we stopped in Kirksville, MO for the night (and I found my first cache in the snow!) We made it home safe and sound on Sunday morning, and with a hearty respect for Mother Nature. Many thanks to all of the cachers who placed the hides we found on our trip!\n\nSunday morning, I woke up to a lovely blanket of snow and took the geo-pibble for a walk in it. Turns out, she loves snow! After a morning meetup at the golden arches for coffee, November Ghost and I took the jeep out to make some fresh tracks through the field of white. There was a backpack on the ground near the cache. And some plastic grocery bags filled with brown lumps. Yeah... thanks for the smiley anyway!"

Yes, that would be the same day a snowstorm was predicted to blow through. Despite logic, our adventurous streak prevailed, and we left from Columbia, MO, early in the day to visit Ottumwa, IA, where November Ghost has family roots. Ottumwa is quite charming! I learned how delicious a canteen lunch is while overhearing the locals discussing the brewing snow. Still un-phased by the talk of ferocious flurries, we spent the afternoon finding many fine caches. Our trip included a visit to Ghost\u2019s past and a test of courage involving climbing up the slippery branches of a tree in the rain. You bet we exchanged some high fives after tackling that one. Around 5 or 6, it finally dawned on us that there was supposed to be some inclement weather on the way. Still, we dilly-dallied at a diner before finally getting out on the road as the sun was setting. Did I mention that I\u2019m from the south, and that I\u2019d never driven through snow before? November Ghost was behind the wheel\u2026 but that doesn\u2019t mean he could actually see the road. And neither could I. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been that terrified due to weather. Now I know what those bumps on the sides of the lane are for! Driving blind proved to be much too stressful, so we stopped in Kirksville, MO for the night (and I found my first cache in the snow!) We made it home safe and sound on Sunday morning, and with a hearty respect for Mother Nature. Many thanks to all of the cachers who placed the hides we found on our trip!\n\nSunday morning, I woke up to a lovely blanket of snow and took the geo-pibble for a walk in it. Turns out, she loves snow! After a morning meetup at the golden arches for coffee, November Ghost and I took the jeep out to make some fresh tracks through the field of white. We found this cache with ease, signed the log, and continued on our way home. Thanks for the smiley!"

The rest of the day was quite delightful and the weather kept getting better and better before ending in Columbia, MO.

I have chosen the area because there is many areas you can park and still get to more than one cache by walking and then can get back into your vehicle and park again to get the next set of caches. You can also if you want walk or bike the nice trails in the area to get to most of the caches. There are also many things to do in the park, plan to bring the family and stay for more enjoyment after your cache adventure that will take you to many areas of the park including around the lake which will give you good views. If you do bring your kids please watch them when around vehicle used areas and the lake caches are not next to the water and you will have several feet if they get away from you. Most to all the cache should not take long to find depending on your expertise.V1p3rx and I have worked to make the series fun and not finding the same old thing over and over. You will find a couple different styles of hides and also one that is maybe not be the expected way to retrieve the cache from the rest of the series. Stealth may be required due to being close to trails, or areas people may visit. We have attempted to give you geocover in all areas but it is a park. Please make sure the cache is hidden well when you place it back into its hiding spot. There is a archery range in the area so use caution even though caches are not placed in the area of the archery. Hope you enjoy the area and caches available in the park and this series. \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Charles (Sparky) Monroe Schulz was born on November 22nd, 1922 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, but grow up in St. Paul Minnesota at the age of 77 he passed away on February 12<sup>th</sup>, 2000 in Santa Rosa, California.

Linus is the only one that believes in the Great Pumpkin, but can occasionally convince others the Great Pumpkin is real for a short time. \u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n<p>When Geocaching please respect and follow the rules of the park.</p>\n<p>The Park is open to the public daily from 5:00 a.m.-11:00 p.m.</p>\n<p>Do not damage any of the parks property, tress, or other wildlife.</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy the park and its amenities.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Congratulations to Arthur &amp; Trillian &amp; dphicky on Co- FTF</p>"

It pinged again...and again...and AGAIN! All told, I saw eight caches pop up!\n\nThere was no way I was going to let them slide, so I messaged dphickey and asked him if he wanted to go on an epic FTF run with me. At first he said he couldn't go. I knew I was going anyway, so I told him I'd check as I got closer to Columbia. Sure enough, when I got close to town, he said he was able and ready to go! I picked him up and we took off north to Moberly!\n\nThis was the fourth cache of the evening. I pulled into the park, only to see the gates closed and locked. Looking at the cache page, it said that the park closed at 11 p.m., so we went for it, leaving the car parked at the gate. We walked to the appointed area and I immediately beaded onto a likely spot. Searching high and low yielded nothing until I glanced at another nearby tree where this was hidden. Bingo.\n\nFTF-3 DNF-1\n\nThanks for the fun cache! TNLN/SL TFTC!\n\n-Fulton, MO"

Hours on the cache page indicated we were well within the hours of the park so we walked the rest of the way in, and after arriving at what appeared to be GZ we came up blank.   Hmm, maybe look around and the flashlight fell on another spot very close by that was not visible in the dark and trees (couldn't see the tree in the forest so to speak) and another quick search found the subject of the cache and his blanket.

Finally we arrived at the last cache in the park I had not found.  We made our way down the access road and onto ground zero.  I spotted the telltale tree right off.   Logged the cache and we headed off to another park so A&T could log the last of the Peanuts caches he needed.  TFTC!"

I was making my rounds on the internet when I checked the geocaching website and lo and behold, the caches were not found yet! What the heck, I figured...let's go for them!\n\nSo, I packed up my stuff and took off. In no time, I was there. I got to ground zero just fine and found the container.

You can also if you want walk or bike the nice trails in the area to get to most of the caches. There are also many things to do in the park, plan to bring the family and stay for more enjoyment after your cache adventure that will take you to many areas of the park including around the lake which will give you good views. If you do bring your kids please watch them when around vehicle used areas and the lake caches are not next to the water and you will have several feet if they get away from you. Most to all the cache should not take long to find depending on your expertise.V1p3rx and I have worked to make the series fun and not finding the same old thing over and over. You will find a couple different styles of hides and also one that is maybe not be the expected way to retrieve the cache from the rest of the series. Stealth may be required due to being close to trails, or areas people may visit. We have attempted to give you geocover in all areas but it is a park. Please make sure the cache is hidden well when you place it back into its hiding spot. There is a archery range in the area so use caution even though caches are not placed in the area of the archery. Hope you enjoy the area and caches available in the park and this series. \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Charles (Sparky) Monroe Schulz was born on November 22nd, 1922 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, but grow up in St. Paul Minnesota at the age of 77 he passed away on February 12<sup>th</sup>, 2000 in Santa Rosa, California.

So today, with nothing better to do, I decided to run to Moberly and find all the caches I have not found yet in the series and not in the series.  Then Arthur and Trillian texted me and I filled him in on my plans.   We modified our plans for him to join me and grab the caches he needed.    After the FTF find, we both wanted to revenge the DNF we had on this on our last FTF trip.   After pulling up and parking A&T started to read Unitzoid's FTF log.  One line in the log made me think that the cache was not in the area we searched before and I immediately started looking for areas that fit the other hides in the series.  Bingo, I spotted it from about 15 feet away.   A quick read of the GPS showed it was about 60 feet off from the posted coords.  I signed the log as A&T took a reading to share for future finders.

He wanted to avenge some DNF's, find some new caches and go for a FTF! Well, we teamed up to go accomplish these very goals. I needed a couple he had and he needed a couple I had, so with mutual goals, we set off!\n\nThis was one of the DNF's that we both needed to avenge. We got to the same parking area we went to last time and prepared to engage in a long hunt. I was barely out of the vehicle, ready to get to business, when all of a sudden dphickey announced he had found it! So quickly? Yes he did! It's like he channeled the cache owner's knowledge. No matter...we signed the log, happy to have avenged the DNF we had earlier.\n\nWe noticed the cache was about 60-65 feet away from where ground zero was, so we took a new set of coordinates. They may not be exact, but they will bring you a lot closer to where  the cache will be.\n\nThanks for the fun cache! TNLN/SL TFTC!\n\n-Fulton, MO"

I picked him up and we took off north to Moberly!\n\nThis was the fifth cache of the evening. We arrived at the location for this cache and began the search. We searched and we searched.

You can also if you want walk or bike the nice trails in the area to get to most of the caches. There are also many things to do in the park, plan to bring the family and stay for more enjoyment after your cache adventure that will take you to many areas of the park including around the lake which will give you good views. If you do bring your kids please watch them when around vehicle used areas and the lake caches are not next to the water and you will have several feet if they get away from you. Most to all the cache should not take long to find depending on your expertise.V1p3rx and I have worked to make the series fun and not finding the same old thing over and over. You will find a couple different styles of hides and also one that is maybe not be the expected way to retrieve the cache from the rest of the series. Stealth may be required due to being close to trails, or areas people may visit. We have attempted to give you geocover in all areas but it is a park. Please make sure the cache is hidden well when you place it back into its hiding spot. There is a archery range in the area so use caution even though caches are not placed in the area of the archery. Hope you enjoy the area and caches available in the park and this series. \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Charles (Sparky) Monroe Schulz was born on November 22nd, 1922 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, but grow up in St. Paul Minnesota at the age of 77 he passed away on February 12<sup>th</sup>, 2000 in Santa Rosa, California.

Schulz never had assistants creating the strip and refused to hire an inker or letterer. On December 14<sup>th</sup> 1999 Schulz announced his retirement due to having several small strokes and a blocked aorta. It was later discovered he had colon cancer that had metastasized. Once Schulz started chemotherapy he was unable to see clearly. Schulz on February 12<sup>th</sup>, 2000 died in his sleep around 9:45 P.M. from colon cancer.

So today, with nothing better to do, I decided to run to Moberly and find all the caches I have not found yet in the series and not in the series.  Then Arthur and Trillian texted me and I filled him in on my plans.   We modified our plans for him to join me and grab the caches he needed.    We decided to go after the FTF first.  We made our way up 63 then to the park.   We parked in a familiar area only this time in daylight.   We quickly made our way across the railroad and into the woods.   A&T spotted the cache and after a breif wait for the retreival we had a fresh virgin log.   CO-FTF for us.   After signing in we moved on to the next cache to revenge a DNF.  TFTC!"

He wanted to avenge some DNF's, find some new caches and go for a FTF! Well, we teamed up to go accomplish these very goals. I needed a couple he had and he needed a couple I had, so with mutual goals, we set off!\n\nWe decided to go for the FTF attempt first, so this is the one we attacked. We parked in a very similar spot where we got another FTF a week or so ago, and took off toward the cache. The walk was nice and easy and in no time we were at ground zero. Cache was in hand very quickly, and we were delighted to find a blank log! We happily scribbled out FTF initials, put everything back as it was, and took off toward the next cache.\n\nThanks for the fun cache! TNLN/SL TFTC!\n\n-Fulton, MO"

You can also if you want walk or bike the nice trails in the area to get to most of the caches. There are also many things to do in the park, plan to bring the family and stay for more enjoyment after your cache adventure that will take you to many areas of the park including around the lake which will give you good views. If you do bring your kids please watch them when around vehicle used areas and the lake caches are not next to the water and you will have several feet if they get away from you. Most to all the cache should not take long to find depending on your expertise.V1p3rx and I have worked to make the series fun and not finding the same old thing over and over. You will find a couple different styles of hides and also one that is maybe not be the expected way to retrieve the cache from the rest of the series. Stealth may be required due to being close to trails, or areas people may visit. We have attempted to give you geocover in all areas but it is a park. Please make sure the cache is hidden well when you place it back into its hiding spot. There is a archery range in the area so use caution even though caches are not placed in the area of the archery. Hope you enjoy the area and caches available in the park and this series. \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Charles (Sparky) Monroe Schulz was born on November 22nd, 1922 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, but grow up in St. Paul Minnesota at the age of 77 he passed away on February 12<sup>th</sup>, 2000 in Santa Rosa, California.

It pinged again...and again...and AGAIN! All told, I saw eight caches pop up!\n\nThere was no way I was going to let them slide, so I messaged dphickey and asked him if he wanted to go on an epic FTF run with me. At first he said he couldn't go. I knew I was going anyway, so I told him I'd check as I got closer to Columbia. Sure enough, when I got close to town, he said he was able and ready to go! I picked him up and we took off north to Moberly!\n\nThis was the eighth and final cache of the evening. We arrived at the best location I could find to park and set off into the woods. We walked to and fro and about halfway into the trip, the batteries on my GPSr died! Oh well...here comes the phone! Not my favorite way, but you gotta do what you gotta do. Anyway, we made the journey just fine and found the final pristine log.\n\nFTF-6 DNF-2\n\nThanks for the fun cache! TNLN/SL TFTC!\n\n-Fulton, MO"

We parked .21 miles from the cache and made our way to GZ via an access road new the children's train tracks. Then things got tougher as the road veered off and we bushwhacked into the woods at around  .1 mile from the cache.   The closer we got the more I ran into sticker bushes and low hanging branches....   I don't recommend being crazy like some certain cachers who did this at night.   But it's December and I didn't run into any spider webs or pick up any ticks and we were geocaching... so all was good.   Once we got withing 20 feet we saw what we thought would be the spot and sure enough there was stoic piano player with the clean log that we got to put the first signatures on.   All in all a great series and I will definitely return for the 2 DNFS and the 2 or 3 of the other caches in the series that were published earlier.  TFTC!"

Caching along the way always seams to make the time go by faster, but also adds 6 hours to the trip.  \nWe only found 100 caches total including all the events.  Every one of the caches was special for some reason.  I picked up 35+ new counties, several virtuals, larges, Earth caches, letterboxes, and a couple wherigos we even found about 50 waymarks, some benchmarks and some labs caches.  Some highlights of the trip were seeing the arch, seeing a flash mob broken up by police, SWAG Dragon falling flat into a ditch full of stinky water, being at our first Geowoodstock, and exploring some of the rich local history.  I enjoyed seeing some fellow Colorado cachers 1000 miles away.  The answers for the VCs, and ECs are being sent by Joe Friday, OneKindWord or Egnix.  Let me know if I need to sort through the pics and notes and answer myself. We used a group stamp most of the time. Thank you for placing this cache and keeping it going.  I am glad it was a part of the overall experience of going on a road trip to Geowoodstock."

The rest of the day was quite delightful and the weather kept getting better and better before ending in Columbia, MO.  Most of my good friends going to GWS were well on their way to the event and I had hoped to see some on the journey, but I wound up not crossing paths with anyone though I evidently crossed paths with some of my Maryland friends near Macon or Moberly today.

I agreed thinking that I could do a few things around the house later in the week & maybe have a couple days just for me the 2nd week. This was last Tuesday (7/8/14)! Little did I know that the counties she wanted to pick up were in Montana, South Dakota, Nebraska, Wyoming Colorado & Kansas. So much for a short day trip & getting a few things done around the house or a few days just for me! Ok, so it was really mostly my idea & she just agreed to tag along as long as I let her try to find all the caches she possibly could !Here's how it really went:I am off work & thought that since neither of us had ever been to North & South Dakota or Montana and she had never been to most of the other states out this way it would be fun to go caching out here. We left last Tuesday & are having a blast going places we have never been, seeing historic places & just places that are different & unusual. To make it even better we are finding all kinds of caches, meeting (unexpectedly) other cachers, trading bugs out, meeting & talking to people we have never met & will probably never meet again. This is what life is all about. I can hardly wait until I retire in another year or so. TN LN SL Thanks so much for making this trip fun with the cache you hid just for us to find!"

Eventually I punched through a line of thunderstorms while moving west from Edina to Kirksville.  The rest of the day was quite delightful and the weather kept getting better and better before ending in Columbia, MO.  Most of my good friends going to GWS were well on their way to the event and I had hoped to see some on the journey, but I wound up not crossing paths with anyone though I evidently crossed paths with some of my Maryland friends near Macon or Moberly today.  Lots of fun caches to be had today!\n\nI wasn't sure of the path to the cache at first, thinking it was private property.  But I took a chance and it led me right back to Martha and the cache.  A large bird lost a significant battle along the pathway by the barn, and most of its carcass was right there and feathers were all over the path for a span of about 150 feet.\n\nTook a moment to spot the cache, but it was in great shape!

I have family ties to Ottumwa so we concentrated our caches in the area for the most part. After having lunch, caching, visiting grandparents and all around enjoying ourselves, it was time to head back ... in a snow storm ... in the dark ... going 30 MPH on the highway. Needless to say we stopped for the night in Kirksville, MO and decided to local cache in the snow and it turned out to be very fun!\n\nthis one required hiking through the snow and getting cold feet!

Yes, that would be the same day a snowstorm was predicted to blow through. Despite logic, our adventurous streak prevailed, and we left from Columbia, MO, early in the day to visit Ottumwa, IA, where November Ghost has family roots. Ottumwa is quite charming! I learned how delicious a canteen lunch is while overhearing the locals discussing the brewing snow. Still un-phased by the talk of ferocious flurries, we spent the afternoon finding many fine caches. Our trip included a visit to Ghost\u2019s past and a test of courage involving climbing up the slippery branches of a tree in the rain. You bet we exchanged some high fives after tackling that one. Around 5 or 6, it finally dawned on us that there was supposed to be some inclement weather on the way. Still, we dilly-dallied at a diner before finally getting out on the road as the sun was setting. Did I mention that I\u2019m from the south, and that I\u2019d never driven through snow before? November Ghost was behind the wheel\u2026 but that doesn\u2019t mean he could actually see the road. And neither could I. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been that terrified due to weather. Now I know what those bumps on the sides of the lane are for! Driving blind proved to be much too stressful, so we stopped in Kirksville, MO for the night (and I found my first cache in the snow!) We made it home safe and sound on Sunday morning, and with a hearty respect for Mother Nature. Many thanks to all of the cachers who placed the hides we found on our trip!\n\nSunday morning, I woke up to a lovely blanket of snow and took the geo-pibble for a walk in it. Turns out, she loves snow! After a morning meetup at the golden arches for coffee, November Ghost and I took the jeep out to make some fresh tracks through the field of white. Finding this cache took a few, but with frozen hands we signed the log. Thanks!"

Drove over 700 miles through rain, snow and sun, but it was all worth it for the joy of more smilies!  Thanks to all the CO\u2019s for creating and maintaining these hides for my enjoyment, especially the old ones!  Cache on!\n\nAnother quick find, another MO county.  Thanks!!"

Yes, that would be the same day a snowstorm was predicted to blow through. Despite logic, our adventurous streak prevailed, and we left from Columbia, MO, early in the day to visit Ottumwa, IA, where November Ghost has family roots. Ottumwa is quite charming! I learned how delicious a canteen lunch is while overhearing the locals discussing the brewing snow. Still un-phased by the talk of ferocious flurries, we spent the afternoon finding many fine caches. Our trip included a visit to Ghost\u2019s past and a test of courage involving climbing up the slippery branches of a tree in the rain. You bet we exchanged some high fives after tackling that one. Around 5 or 6, it finally dawned on us that there was supposed to be some inclement weather on the way. Still, we dilly-dallied at a diner before finally getting out on the road as the sun was setting. Did I mention that I\u2019m from the south, and that I\u2019d never driven through snow before? November Ghost was behind the wheel\u2026 but that doesn\u2019t mean he could actually see the road. And neither could I. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been that terrified due to weather. Now I know what those bumps on the sides of the lane are for! Driving blind proved to be much too stressful, so we stopped in Kirksville, MO for the night (and I found my first cache in the snow!) We made it home safe and sound on Sunday morning, and with a hearty respect for Mother Nature. Many thanks to all of the cachers who placed the hides we found on our trip!\n\nSunday morning, I woke up to a lovely blanket of snow and took the geo-pibble for a walk in it. Turns out, she loves snow! After a morning meetup at the golden arches for coffee, November Ghost and I took the jeep out to make some fresh tracks through the field of white. This park-n-grab was a fun find today. Thanks!"

It's a fitting place as other geocachers have attested to.  The find was quick, but blimey was it getting cold and gusty out there!

We met up and took off to the sparsely inhabited reaches of the area. Along the way, we picked up some caches that I already had but dphickey didn't. We did park and grabs and we did quite a few on an extended hike. The views were awesome and the weather perfect. Thanks for placing this cache, as it added to the day's fun!

Today was the day I finally arrived at GW XII.  I started the journey in Colombia, MO but had a lot of counties to clean up in Missouri before I finally made it to the event location.  Even though it was about 100 miles from Columbia to St. Charles, I think I wound up driving over 300 miles to get a whole bunch of caches up to Hannibal and after zigging and zagging around.  Weather was good most of the day, however the muggle factor was rather intense on the Friday before Memorial Day and law enforcement was everywhere and were extrememly intense!\n\nAlmost didn't pull into the driveway when I realized how \"private\" this area was.  But re-read the cache description and saw everything was okay.  Pulled in around 9:30am in my Black Nissan Senta (rented) and found nobody out and about.  I quickly found the cache and signed it, noting the attachment is not really attached to the container anymore, but it will hold for now.  Looked for the CO to see if they were out and about on the farm but did not see anybody.  Waved at the house on the way out and continued on my journey.\n\nTFTC and sharing the wonderful views from your property."

Today was the day I finally arrived at GW XII.  I started the journey in Colombia, MO but had a lot of counties to clean up in Missouri before I finally made it to the event location.  Even though it was about 100 miles from Columbia to St. Charles, I think I wound up driving over 300 miles to get a whole bunch of caches up to Hannibal and after zigging and zagging around.  Weather was good most of the day, however the muggle factor was rather intense on the Friday before Memorial Day and law enforcement was everywhere and were extrememly intense!\n\nA bit of an adventure to this cache location today.  Many of the roads my Nuvi wanted me to take didn't seem ot actually exist, and those that did seem to be closed for construction.  I eventually spiraled my way in towards the cache's location and was rewarded with a splendid view from a picturesque old bridge of a creek eroding out the bluff.  Took a little bit of searching but found the nicely hidden cache after a brief search.  TFTC.\n\nAttaching a few photos."

Since this one hadn't been found yet, and the better half was supposed to be delayed getting home, I decided to head out after work.  I figured I'd get there while it was still light, and all would be good.  \n\nI made it to what my GPSrs were telling me was the cache location, but I knew I was not in the right place, and I was pretty sure I knew what was wrong.  I pulled out my phone, and checked the coordinates (while they are in my GSAK databas, I hadn't yet transferred them to my devices.  I'd manually entered them before I set out.  I stared at the phone.  Is that 25 or 26?  I have no idea.  I pulled up the menu on TomTom, and I had entered 25.  I guess it's 26.  Re-entered the correct number, and continued off down the road (after two 15 point turns).  I approach ground zero, and think that this is it.  I top the hill, and there's a deer hunter at his vehicle, walking around.  Okay.  I can wait him out, which I did.  He left, and I poked in a 26, and set off.  It took a few minutes for the Garmin to settle down, but I found the container fairly quickly, and set about signing the log.  I signed in the first-to-find spot, just above the \"NOT first to find,\" Unitzoid.  Had to sign using a flashlight because daylight had abandoned me.  Just as I was replacing the cache, the coyotes started in a few hundred yards away.  I decided it was time to leave this aptly named cache, and return to my car.
