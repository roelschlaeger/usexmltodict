Geocaching with Mean Gene and The Rooter, logging caches as "MG/TR/RO", in the Springfield, Illinois area. We passed by the cache on our way to GZ then expanded the search radius when we didn't find the cache right away. I spotted the cache past Mean Gene as he was between me and the creek.

Geocaching with Mean Gene and The Rooter, logging caches as "MG/TR/RO", in the Springfield, Illinois area. The little tree in which this cache had been placed was 60% carbon when we got there, so we left a replacement in its nearby neighbor to the north -- which isn't faring all that well, but at least it hasn't been burned to a crisp. Thanks, searching_simpsons, for placing this cache! -- roelsch, Saint Charles, MO.</groundspeak:text>

SVT Colors Series is along the Sangamon Valley Trail. You will be walking or biking a long distance so if you intend on trying to complete this whole series at one time we highly recommend you take along water to keep yourself hydrated.
 
These are home made traditional micro size caches which hold a log sheet only so please bring your own writing utencil.
 
This is a series of micro size caches along the Sangamon Valley Bike Trail on the west side of Springfield. Our goal is to make this series go the entire length of the trail. The trail is paved so it will be easy biking or walking to the cache locations but once you get to the destination you will find you have a little bit of bushwacking and some rough footing to actually get to the cache with the exception of a couple of them. These should be fairly easy to spot once you get close. Please be aware there may be some plants stickers or your may get a tick or two as you will be in the weedy and wooded area looking for these caches so please wear the proper attire for Geocaching.
 
This cache owner:
 Maintains thier own caches.
 Please advise if there is a problem.
 If you find the coords to be way off please email them to me and I will update them
 Appreciates logs that are not cut and pasted :) Be creative
 As always PLEASE be careful out there
 
Congrats to Mrori on the FTF!!!!

Good luck and Happy hunting!!!!</groundspeak:long_description>

Distance: 5.5 Miles
 
The Sangamon Valley Trail is a mostly shaded route that takes travelers from Stuart Park on the northwest side of town to Centennial Park on the southwest side. The trail includes scenic bridges over highway 97, Washington St, and Old Jacksonville Rd. Additionally, there is a bridge over the valley between Highway 97 and Washington St. Future expansion includes extending the trail north to Athens and South to Girard.
 
Trail Head:
 Stuart Park (parking lot)
 Centennial Park (parking lot)
 
Residential Access:
 Harrison Park Subdivision
 Meadowbrook Rd. Archer
 Elevator Rd. W.
 Iles Ave.
 
SVT Colors Series is along the Sangamon Valley Trail. You will be walking or biking a long distance so if you intend on trying to complete this whole series at one time we highly recommend you take along water to keep yourself hydrated.
 
These are home made traditional micro size caches which hold a log sheet only so please bring your own writing utencil.
 
This is a series of micro size caches along the Sangamon Valley Bike Trail on the west side of Springfield. Our goal is to make this series go the entire length of the trail. The trail is paved so it will be easy biking or walking to the cache locations but once you get to the destination you will find you have a little bit of bushwacking and some rough footing to actually get to the cache with the exception of a couple of them. These should be fairly easy to spot once you get close. Please be aware there may be some plants stickers or your may get a tick or two as you will be in the weedy and wooded area looking for these caches so please wear the proper attire for Geocaching.
 
This cache owner:
 Maintains thier own caches.
 Please advise if there is a problem.
 If you find the coords to be way off please email them to me and I will update them
 Appreciates logs that are not cut and pasted :) Be creative

   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;ULTIMATE GUY COMEDY MOVIES&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:1.6em;"&gt;I’ve decided to create a series of caches based on lines from the ULTIMATE GUY COMEDY MOVIES!  Women may or may not like these, but to be considered a real man, you need to have seen each of these movies (often several times).  To meet the requirements, the movie has to have stood the test of time (be at least 10 years old) and be a great movie for guys (sorry ladies, but we don’t always get into those “romantic comedies”). You can keep Hugh Grant, give me Mel Brooks or John Belushi any day!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:1.6em;"&gt;These will not be at the exact location, but will be somewhere nearby.  To find it, you have to figure out the movie which will then give you the exact coordinates.  Once you find it, you will need to provide your own writing instrument and log it.  Finally, when you get home, you may have these lines stuck in your head and might feel an overwhelming urge to watch the move again (for the 142&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup style="line-height:1.6em;"&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;span style="line-height:1.6em;"&gt;time).  Feel free to give into these urges!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:1.6em;"&gt;Coordinates:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;N 39  44.A3B&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;W 89  44.C15&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:1.6em;"&gt;A = the second number of the year the movie was released&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B = the third number of the year the movie was released&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C = the sum of the first and last numbers of the year the movie was released&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;i&gt;Why here? Check out the street name.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

After finishing up on the trails we grabbed a couple others around the area.  We found the cache in it's hiding spot but the hiding spot has been pulled out of the ground and is laying flat on the ground now.  Construction equipment is parked nearby .  TFTC.</groundspeak:text>

I "called" this one as we drove up... and then was surprised that the cache was actually exactly where I'd "called".
