We drove right to the cache area and Mean Gene found the cache pretty quickly, but we didn't get the name of the cache until we were pulling away... and then it made perfect sense. I thought that this might have once been a Rest Stop, but Mean Gene is sure that it used to be part of the old highway. TNLNSL. Thanks, schnauzermomx2! -- roelsch, St. Charles, MO

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This is one of the four hides you'll need to find the mother cache, the Four Deuces Cache. Add the three numbers you'll find in this container (I've put it there several places), to the number you'll find in the "Deuces are Wild - Diamonds" cache to obtain the final three numbers for the West coordinate of the "Four Deuces Cache."

I noticed this treeline alongside this very un-busy road one day while driving to Springfield. I drove back to take a look and determined that it would be a great place to drop off one of the Deuces are Wild caches.

It's a nice, easy find, with virtually no bushwhacking. You can park right on the road without worry of traffic and be less than 125 feet from the cache. Muggles could be a problem, but just of the curious sort. 

There are no treasures inside to trade, but the container is big enough to hold small items or small-sized travel bugs if you want to leave something. Please make sure you secure the lid when you re-hide the cache, so it doesn't fill with water from rains.

This should be a pretty easy cache, so no hint will be given. You can email me for help if you need it.</groundspeak:long_description>

This was a good location for a hide, even though I missed the correct turn into the area, so we came around the long way. I spotted the cache just a second before Mean Gene; nice easy hide.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;ULTIMATE GUY COMEDY MOVIES&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:1.6em;"&gt;I’ve decided to create a series of caches based on lines from the ULTIMATE GUY COMEDY MOVIES!  Women may or may not like these, but to be considered a real man, you need to have seen each of these movies (often several times).  To meet the requirements, the movie has to have stood the test of time (be at least 10 years old) and be a great movie for guys (sorry ladies, but we don’t always get into those “romantic comedies”). You can keep Hugh Grant, give me Mel Brooks or John Belushi any day!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:1.6em;"&gt;These will not be at the exact location, but will be somewhere nearby.  To find it, you have to figure out the movie which will then give you the exact coordinates.  Once you find it, you will need to provide your own writing instrument and log it.  Finally, when you get home, you may have these lines stuck in your head and might feel an overwhelming urge to watch the move again (for the 142&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup style="line-height:1.6em;"&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;span style="line-height:1.6em;"&gt;time).  Feel free to give into these urges!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Distance: 5.5 Miles
 
The Sangamon Valley Trail is a mostly shaded route that takes travelers from Stuart Park on the northwest side of town to Centennial Park on the southwest side. The trail includes scenic bridges over highway 97, Washington St, and Old Jacksonville Rd. Additionally, there is a bridge over the valley between Highway 97 and Washington St. Future expansion includes extending the trail north to Athens and South to Girard.
 
Trail Head:
 Stuart Park (parking lot)
 Centennial Park (parking lot)
 
Residential Access:
 Harrison Park Subdivision
 Meadowbrook Rd. Archer
 Elevator Rd. W.
 Iles Ave.
 
SVT Colors Series is along the Sangamon Valley Trail. You will be walking or biking a long distance so if you intend on trying to complete this whole series at one time we highly recommend you take along water to keep yourself hydrated.
 
These are home made traditional micro size caches which hold a log sheet only so please bring your own writing utencil.
 
This is a series of micro size caches along the Sangamon Valley Bike Trail on the west side of Springfield. Our goal is to make this series go the entire length of the trail. The trail is paved so it will be easy biking or walking to the cache locations but once you get to the destination you will find you have a little bit of bushwacking and some rough footing to actually get to the cache with the exception of a couple of them. These should be fairly easy to spot once you get close. Please be aware there may be some plants stickers or your may get a tick or two as you will be in the weedy and wooded area looking for these caches so please wear the proper attire for Geocaching.
 
This cache owner:
 Maintains thier own caches.
 Please advise if there is a problem.
 If you find the coords to be way off please email them to me and I will update them
 Appreciates logs that are not cut and pasted :) Be creative
 As always PLEASE be careful out there
 
Congrats to Mrori on the FTF!!!!

Good luck and Happy hunting!!!!</groundspeak:long_description>

The cache is about 1/2 mile from the interstate and has easy parking by the side of the road.  Be careful when you leave as traffic from the west is on a curve and hard to see.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Pier went for this one while Port waited in the car. Old man stopped and asked Pier if she was Ok. Then he wanted to know if she was geocaching. He told her he had a GPS with just geocaching on it. Didn't seem like he knew much about geocaching though. After he left, Pier went for the cache. It was nicely hidden and so nice to find a container like this again. It's been awhile since we have seen one. The travel bugs shown in the cache don't seem to be there.  Rehid the cache.

We thought there was parking where there wasn't so we did a turnaround after passing the cache and came back to the other side, where there was parking for a car or two. I spotted this one as we were yet several yards away. TNLNSL. Thanks, 2~Sherlocks! -- roelsch, St. Charles, MO

Distance: 5.5 Miles
 
The Sangamon Valley Trail is a mostly shaded route that takes travelers from Stuart Park on the northwest side of town to Centennial Park on the southwest side. The trail includes scenic bridges over highway 97, Washington St, and Old Jacksonville Rd. Additionally, there is a bridge over the valley between Highway 97 and Washington St. Future expansion includes extending the trail north to Athens and South to Girard.
 
Trail Head:
 Stuart Park (parking lot)
 Centennial Park (parking lot)
 
Residential Access:
 Harrison Park Subdivision
 Meadowbrook Rd. Archer
 Elevator Rd. W.
 Iles Ave.
 
SVT Colors Series is along the Sangamon Valley Trail. You will be walking or biking a long distance so if you intend on trying to complete this whole series at one time we highly recommend you take along water to keep yourself hydrated.
 
These are home made traditional micro size caches which hold a log sheet only so please bring your own writing utencil.
 
This is a series of micro size caches along the Sangamon Valley Bike Trail on the west side of Springfield. Our goal is to make this series go the entire length of the trail. The trail is paved so it will be easy biking or walking to the cache locations but once you get to the destination you will find you have a little bit of bushwacking and some rough footing to actually get to the cache with the exception of a couple of them. These should be fairly easy to spot once you get close. Please be aware there may be some plants stickers or your may get a tick or two as you will be in the weedy and wooded area looking for these caches so please wear the proper attire for Geocaching.
 
This cache owner:
 Maintains thier own caches.
 Please advise if there is a problem.
 If you find the coords to be way off please email them to me and I will update them
 Appreciates logs that are not cut and pasted :) Be creative
 As always PLEASE be careful out there
 
Congrats to Mrori on the FTF!!!!

Distance: 5.5 Miles
 
The Sangamon Valley Trail is a mostly shaded route that takes travelers from Stuart Park on the northwest side of town to Centennial Park on the southwest side. The trail includes scenic bridges over highway 97, Washington St, and Old Jacksonville Rd. Additionally, there is a bridge over the valley between Highway 97 and Washington St. Future expansion includes extending the trail north to Athens and South to Girard.
 
Trail Head:
 Stuart Park (parking lot)
 Centennial Park (parking lot)
 
Residential Access:
 Harrison Park Subdivision
 Meadowbrook Rd. Archer
 Elevator Rd. W.
 Iles Ave.
 
SVT Colors Series is along the Sangamon Valley Trail. You will be walking or biking a long distance so if you intend on trying to complete this whole series at one time we highly recommend you take along water to keep yourself hydrated.
 
These are home made traditional micro size caches which hold a log sheet only so please bring your own writing utencil.
 
This is a series of micro size caches along the Sangamon Valley Bike Trail on the west side of Springfield. Our goal is to make this series go the entire length of the trail. The trail is paved so it will be easy biking or walking to the cache locations but once you get to the destination you will find you have a little bit of bushwacking and some rough footing to actually get to the cache with the exception of a couple of them. These should be fairly easy to spot once you get close. Please be aware there may be some plants stickers or your may get a tick or two as you will be in the weedy and wooded area looking for these caches so please wear the proper attire for Geocaching.
 
This cache owner:
 Maintains thier own caches.
 Please advise if there is a problem.
 If you find the coords to be way off please email them to me and I will update them
 Appreciates logs that are not cut and pasted :) Be creative
 As always PLEASE be careful out there
 
Congrats to Mrori on the FTF!!!!

Distance: 5.5 Miles
 
The Sangamon Valley Trail is a mostly shaded route that takes travelers from Stuart Park on the northwest side of town to Centennial Park on the southwest side. The trail includes scenic bridges over highway 97, Washington St, and Old Jacksonville Rd. Additionally, there is a bridge over the valley between Highway 97 and Washington St. Future expansion includes extending the trail north to Athens and South to Girard.
 
Trail Head:
 Stuart Park (parking lot)
 Centennial Park (parking lot)
 
Residential Access:
 Harrison Park Subdivision
 Meadowbrook Rd. Archer
 Elevator Rd. W.
 Iles Ave.
 
SVT Colors Series is along the Sangamon Valley Trail. You will be walking or biking a long distance so if you intend on trying to complete this whole series at one time we highly recommend you take along water to keep yourself hydrated.
 
These are home made traditional micro size caches which hold a log sheet only so please bring your own writing utencil.
 
This is a series of micro size caches along the Sangamon Valley Bike Trail on the west side of Springfield. Our goal is to make this series go the entire length of the trail. The trail is paved so it will be easy biking or walking to the cache locations but once you get to the destination you will find you have a little bit of bushwacking and some rough footing to actually get to the cache with the exception of a couple of them. These should be fairly easy to spot once you get close. Please be aware there may be some plants stickers or your may get a tick or two as you will be in the weedy and wooded area looking for these caches so please wear the proper attire for Geocaching.
 
This cache owner:
 Maintains thier own caches.
 Please advise if there is a problem.
 If you find the coords to be way off please email them to me and I will update them
 Appreciates logs that are not cut and pasted :) Be creative
 As always PLEASE be careful out there
 
Congrats to Mrori on the FTF!!!!

Good luck and Happy hunting!!!!</groundspeak:long_description>

SVT Colors Series is along the Sangamon Valley Trail. You will be walking or biking a long distance so if you intend on trying to complete this whole series at one time we highly recommend you take along water to keep yourself hydrated.
 
These are home made traditional micro size caches which hold a log sheet only so please bring your own writing utencil.
 
This is a series of micro size caches along the Sangamon Valley Bike Trail on the west side of Springfield. Our goal is to make this series go the entire length of the trail. The trail is paved so it will be easy biking or walking to the cache locations but once you get to the destination you will find you have a little bit of bushwacking and some rough footing to actually get to the cache with the exception of a couple of them. These should be fairly easy to spot once you get close. Please be aware there may be some plants stickers or your may get a tick or two as you will be in the weedy and wooded area looking for these caches so please wear the proper attire for Geocaching.
 
This cache owner:
 Maintains thier own caches.
 Please advise if there is a problem.
 If you find the coords to be way off please email them to me and I will update them
 Appreciates logs that are not cut and pasted :) Be creative
 As always PLEASE be careful out there
 
Congrats to Mrori on the FTF!!!!

Good luck and Happy hunting!!!!</groundspeak:long_description>

Distance: 5.5 Miles
 
The Sangamon Valley Trail is a mostly shaded route that takes travelers from Stuart Park on the northwest side of town to Centennial Park on the southwest side. The trail includes scenic bridges over highway 97, Washington St, and Old Jacksonville Rd. Additionally, there is a bridge over the valley between Highway 97 and Washington St. Future expansion includes extending the trail north to Athens and South to Girard.
 
Trail Head:
 Stuart Park (parking lot)
 Centennial Park (parking lot)
 
Residential Access:
 Harrison Park Subdivision
 Meadowbrook Rd. Archer
 Elevator Rd. W.
 Iles Ave.
 
SVT Colors Series is along the Sangamon Valley Trail. You will be walking or biking a long distance so if you intend on trying to complete this whole series at one time we highly recommend you take along water to keep yourself hydrated.
 
These are home made traditional micro size caches which hold a log sheet only so please bring your own writing utencil.
 
This is a series of micro size caches along the Sangamon Valley Bike Trail on the west side of Springfield. Our goal is to make this series go the entire length of the trail. The trail is paved so it will be easy biking or walking to the cache locations but once you get to the destination you will find you have a little bit of bushwacking and some rough footing to actually get to the cache with the exception of a couple of them. These should be fairly easy to spot once you get close. Please be aware there may be some plants stickers or your may get a tick or two as you will be in the weedy and wooded area looking for these caches so please wear the proper attire for Geocaching.
 
This cache owner:
 Maintains thier own caches.
 Please advise if there is a problem.
 If you find the coords to be way off please email them to me and I will update them
 Appreciates logs that are not cut and pasted :) Be creative
 As always PLEASE be careful out there
 
Congrats to Mrori on the FTF!!!!

Good luck and Happy hunting!!!!</groundspeak:long_description>

Distance: 5.5 Miles
 
The Sangamon Valley Trail is a mostly shaded route that takes travelers from Stuart Park on the northwest side of town to Centennial Park on the southwest side. The trail includes scenic bridges over highway 97, Washington St, and Old Jacksonville Rd. Additionally, there is a bridge over the valley between Highway 97 and Washington St. Future expansion includes extending the trail north to Athens and South to Girard.
 
Trail Head:
 Stuart Park (parking lot)
 Centennial Park (parking lot)
 
Residential Access:
 Harrison Park Subdivision
 Meadowbrook Rd. Archer
 Elevator Rd. W.
 Iles Ave.
 
SVT Colors Series is along the Sangamon Valley Trail. You will be walking or biking a long distance so if you intend on trying to complete this whole series at one time we highly recommend you take along water to keep yourself hydrated.
 
These are home made traditional micro size caches which hold a log sheet only so please bring your own writing utencil.
 
This is a series of micro size caches along the Sangamon Valley Bike Trail on the west side of Springfield. Our goal is to make this series go the entire length of the trail. The trail is paved so it will be easy biking or walking to the cache locations but once you get to the destination you will find you have a little bit of bushwacking and some rough footing to actually get to the cache with the exception of a couple of them. These should be fairly easy to spot once you get close. Please be aware there may be some plants stickers or your may get a tick or two as you will be in the weedy and wooded area looking for these caches so please wear the proper attire for Geocaching.
 
This cache owner:
 Maintains thier own caches.
 Please advise if there is a problem.
 If you find the coords to be way off please email them to me and I will update them
 Appreciates logs that are not cut and pasted :) Be creative
 As always PLEASE be careful out there
 
Congrats to Mrori on the FTF!!!!

Good luck and Happy hunting!!!!</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">This cache is located in Rotary Park. It's the second one I placed there and the second one logged today, but the first cache I thought of. The difficulty of this one is going to being finding a time when the locations aren't being used and you can complete the series of movements.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This cache has a couple of inspirations. One, my family that often accompanies me and got me started geocaching and two, A View From the Top. I like the idea of having to work with the GPSr in the field. 

The coordinates listed above start you out at the first location. There's parking very close.

This location is dedicated to Lil' H. You'll see what I mean. It should take you to something with a roof over it. You should stand in the middle to set the next point. From here, project a waypoint 0.11 miles at a bearing of 086 degrees. 

This location is dedicated to Mrs. H, who got me started geocaching. You should be close to a base. Stand on the base and project another point 0.06 miles at a bearing of 318 degrees. 

From here you are taken to the cache, and once found, have completed the H series. See the hint below. 

The cache is a medicine container wrapped in black tape. It only contains a log and a pencil. There's probably not much room for anything else. Make sure to put it back how it was originally placed to maintain its low visibility.

Find the cache; sign the log; find the letter stamp inside the cache and stamp a piece of paper as proof that you have found the cache. Do NOT take the letter stamp from the cache – please replace in the cache for the next cacher to find! Once you have found all of the “Words With Cachers” letters / caches that you can, come to the event to be held at 5:30 and show off your Scrabble skills by creating the word with the most points!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As a special bonus, there are two extra letter stickers in each cache. The first and second-to-find cachers can take one sticker each to increase the letters that they have found. Again, please take only one letter sticker if you are the first to find.&lt;br /&gt;

Distance: 5.5 Miles
 
The Sangamon Valley Trail is a mostly shaded route that takes travelers from Stuart Park on the northwest side of town to Centennial Park on the southwest side. The trail includes scenic bridges over highway 97, Washington St, and Old Jacksonville Rd. Additionally, there is a bridge over the valley between Highway 97 and Washington St. Future expansion includes extending the trail north to Athens and South to Girard.
 
Trail Head:
 Stuart Park (parking lot)
 Centennial Park (parking lot)
 
Residential Access:
 Harrison Park Subdivision
 Meadowbrook Rd. Archer
 Elevator Rd. W.
 Iles Ave.
 
SVT Colors Series is along the Sangamon Valley Trail. You will be walking or biking a long distance so if you intend on trying to complete this whole series at one time we highly recommend you take along water to keep yourself hydrated.
 
These are home made traditional micro size caches which hold a log sheet only so please bring your own writing utencil.

This is a series of micro size caches along the Sangamon Valley Bike Trail on the west side of Springfield. Our goal is to make this series go the entire length of the trail. The trail is paved so it will be easy biking or walking to the cache locations but once you get to the destination you will find you have a little bit of bushwacking and some rough footing to actually get to the cache with the exception of a couple of them. These should be fairly easy to spot once you get close. Please be aware there may be some plants stickers or your may get a tick or two as you will be in the weedy and wooded area looking for these caches so please wear the proper attire for Geocaching.

This cache owner:
Maintains thier own caches. Please advise if there is a problem.
If you find the coords to be way off please email them to me and I will update them
Appreciates logs that are not cut and pasted :) Be creative
As always PLEASE be careful out there

Congrats to Mrori on the FTF!!!!

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Beginning this sport in Georgia, I quickly became spoiled. There were tons of quick and easy to find smileys within 15 minutes of where I lived. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the long hike to get one or two smileys sometimes. But then there are times when I might only have 30 to 45 minutes with which to dedicate to caching. Even though this series won't help me with some quick ones, it will give others that opportunity. And hopefully others might get excited about putting more caches out. You never know, Springfield might even become a caching destination. OK, maybe that IS stretching it a bit with that last line. Sorry!

This cache is almost a drive-by. You will have to get out of your vehicle but you'll be able to park less than 15' away. If you feel adventurous, come find it at night. Be careful and watch for muggles!

Distance: 5.5 Miles
 
The Sangamon Valley Trail is a mostly shaded route that takes travelers from Stuart Park on the northwest side of town to Centennial Park on the southwest side. The trail includes scenic bridges over highway 97, Washington St, and Old Jacksonville Rd. Additionally, there is a bridge over the valley between Highway 97 and Washington St. Future expansion includes extending the trail north to Athens and South to Girard.
 
Trail Head:
 Stuart Park (parking lot)
 Centennial Park (parking lot)
 
Residential Access:
 Harrison Park Subdivision
 Meadowbrook Rd. Archer
 Elevator Rd. W.
 Iles Ave.
 
SVT Colors Series is along the Sangamon Valley Trail. You will be walking or biking a long distance so if you intend on trying to complete this whole series at one time we highly recommend you take along water to keep yourself hydrated.
 
These are home made traditional micro size caches which hold a log sheet only so please bring your own writing utencil.

This is a series of micro size caches along the Sangamon Valley Bike Trail on the west side of Springfield. Our goal is to make this series go the entire length of the trail. The trail is paved so it will be easy biking or walking to the cache locations but once you get to the destination you will find you have a little bit of bushwacking and some rough footing to actually get to the cache with the exception of a couple of them. These should be fairly easy to spot once you get close. Please be aware there may be some plants stickers or your may get a tick or two as you will be in the weedy and wooded area looking for these caches so please wear the proper attire for Geocaching.

This cache owner:
Maintains thier own caches. Please advise if there is a problem.
If you find the coords to be way off please email them to me and I will update them
Appreciates logs that are not cut and pasted :) Be creative
As always PLEASE be careful out there

Congrats to Mrori on the FTF!!!!

Distance: 5.5 Miles
 
The Sangamon Valley Trail is a mostly shaded route that takes travelers from Stuart Park on the northwest side of town to Centennial Park on the southwest side. The trail includes scenic bridges over highway 97, Washington St, and Old Jacksonville Rd. Additionally, there is a bridge over the valley between Highway 97 and Washington St. Future expansion includes extending the trail north to Athens and South to Girard.

Trail Head: 
Stuart Park (parking lot) 
Centennial Park (parking lot) 

Residential Access: 
Harrison Park Subdivision 
Meadowbrook Rd. Archer 
Elevator Rd. W. 
Iles Ave. 

SVT Colors Series is along the Sangamon Valley Trail. You will be walking or biking a long distance so if you intend on trying to complete this whole series at one time we highly recommend you take along water to keep yourself hydrated. 

These are home made traditional micro size caches which hold a log sheet only so please bring your own writing utencil.

This is a series of micro size caches along the Sangamon Valley Bike Trail on the west side of Springfield. Our goal is to make this series go the entire length of the trail. The trail is paved so it will be easy biking or walking to the cache locations but once you get to the destination you will find you have a little bit of bushwacking and some rough footing to actually get to the cache with the exception of a couple of them. These should be fairly easy to spot once you get close. Please be aware there may be some plants stickers or your may get a tick or two as you will be in the weedy and wooded area looking for these caches so please wear the proper attire for Geocaching.

This cache owner:
- Maintains thier own caches. Please advise if there is a problem.
- If you find the coords to be way off please email them to me and I will update them
- Appreciates logs that are not cut and pasted :) Be creative
- As always PLEASE be careful out there

Congrats to Mrori on the FTF!!!!

Good luck and Happy hunting!!!!

Distance: 5.5 Miles
 
The Sangamon Valley Trail is a mostly shaded route that takes travelers from Stuart Park on the northwest side of town to Centennial Park on the southwest side. The trail includes scenic bridges over highway 97, Washington St, and Old Jacksonville Rd. Additionally, there is a bridge over the valley between Highway 97 and Washington St. Future expansion includes extending the trail north to Athens and South to Girard.
 
Trail Head:
 Stuart Park (parking lot)
 Centennial Park (parking lot)
 
Residential Access:
 Harrison Park Subdivision
 Meadowbrook Rd.
 Archer Elevator Rd.
 W. Iles Ave.

SVT Colors Series is along the Sangamon Valley Trail. You will be walking or biking a long distance so if you intend on trying to complete this whole series at one time we highly recommend you take along water to keep yourself hydrated.

These are home made traditional micro size caches which hold a log sheet only so please bring your own writing utencil.

This is a series of micro size caches along the Sangamon Valley Bike Trail on the west side of Springfield. Our goal is to make this series go the entire length of the trail. The trail is paved so it will be easy biking or walking to the cache locations but once you get to the destination you will find you have a little bit of bushwacking and some rough footing to actually get to the cache with the exception of a couple of them. These should be fairly easy to spot once you get close. Please be aware there may be some plants stickers or your may get a tick or two as you will be in the weedy and wooded area looking for these caches so please wear the proper attire for Geocaching.

This cache owner:
- Maintains thier own caches. Please advise if there is a problem.
- If you find the coords to be way off please email them to me and I will update them
- Appreciates logs that are not cut and pasted :) Be creative
- As always PLEASE be careful out there

Congrats to Mrori on the FTF!!!!

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This cache is place on a road we travel quite a bit often stopping here just about every Friday night. We are here so often they know us by name so I couldn't resist placing a cache here any longer. This cache might be considered a park and grab but then again it might give a challenge to some of the most seasoned cachers so I have given it a D-4. You just never know what to expect so some may consider this EVIL. This cache is placed in a very mugglesome area so you will definatley need to use your stealth abilities during certain hours of the day and night. Ok, I have added a hint folks so as always Good Luck and Happy Hunting!!!!


This cache owner:
- Maintains thier own caches. Please advise if there is a problem.
- If you find the coords to be way off please email them to me and I will update them
- Appreciates logs that are not cut and pasted :) Be creative
- As always PLEASE be careful out there

Good luck and Happy hunting!!!!</groundspeak:long_description>

Had this one solved prior to the trip so made it a point to head out this way.  Upon approaching ground zero we noticed a good bit of damage to the immediate area and we worried that perhaps the cache had been lost, but alas, it was still there!

Those bar codes aren't easy to read, even if you know which of the 43+ codes to use. I eventually got an answer I could believe and it was confirmed, so we knew where to go for the final. We learned something along the way to finding the answer, and that's always a good thing. TNLNSL. Thanks, GoodHunting! -- roelsch, St. Charles, MO.

Distance: 5.5 Miles
 
The Sangamon Valley Trail is a mostly shaded route that takes travelers from Stuart Park on the northwest side of town to Centennial Park on the southwest side. The trail includes scenic bridges over highway 97, Washington St, and Old Jacksonville Rd. Additionally, there is a bridge over the valley between Highway 97 and Washington St. Future expansion includes extending the trail north to Athens and South to Girard.
 
Trail Head:
 Stuart Park (parking lot)
 Centennial Park (parking lot)
 
Residential Access:
 Harrison Park Subdivision
 Meadowbrook Rd.
 Archer Elevator Rd.
 W. Iles Ave.

This is a traditional micro size bison cache which hold a log sheet only so please bring your own writing utencil.

This is a very easy micro bison cache along the Sangamon Valley Bike Trail. There is no motoring to get to this cache as it is probably the easiest one along the trail. You may have to strech a bit to reach it but it is readily accessible and you may need an extraction tool to get the log out to sign it.

This cache owner:
- Maintains thier own caches. Please advise if there is a problem.
- If you find the coords to be way off please email them to me and I will update them
- Appreciates logs that are not cut and pasted :) Be creative
- As always PLEASE be careful out there

Good luck and Happy hunting!!!!

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:1.6em;"&gt;I’ve decided to create a series of caches based on lines from the ULTIMATE GUY COMEDY MOVIES!  Women may or may not like these, but to be considered a real man, you need to have seen each of these movies (often several times).  To meet the requirements, the movie has to have stood the test of time (be at least 10 years old) and be a great movie for guys (sorry ladies, but we don’t always get into those “romantic comedies”). You can keep Hugh Grant, give me Mel Brooks or John Belushi any day!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:1.6em;"&gt;These will not be at the exact location, but will be somewhere nearby.  To find it, you have to figure out the movie which will then give you the exact coordinates.  Once you find it, you will need to provide your own writing instrument and log it.  Finally, when you get home, you may have these lines stuck in your head and might feel an overwhelming urge to watch the move again (for the 142&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup style="line-height:1.6em;"&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;span style="line-height:1.6em;"&gt;time).  Feel free to give into these urges!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:1.6em;"&gt;Coordinates:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;N 39  44.A52&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;W 89  41.B4C&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:1.6em;"&gt;A = half the third number of the year the movie was released&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B = the sum of the last two numbers of the year the movie was released&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C = the second number of the year the movie was released&lt;/p&gt;
Permission has been granted for this location.
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;i&gt;Why here? Cammo and guns.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Sangamon Valley Trail
 
Distance: 5.5 Miles
 
The Sangamon Valley Trail is a mostly shaded route that takes travelers from Stuart Park on the northwest side of town to Centennial Park on the southwest side. The trail includes scenic bridges over highway 97, Washington St, and Old Jacksonville Rd. Additionally, there is a bridge over the valley between Highway 97 and Washington St. Future expansion includes extending the trail north to Athens and South to Girard.
 
Trail Head:
 Stuart Park (parking lot)
 Centennial Park (parking lot)
 
Residential Access:
 Harrison Park Subdivision
 Meadowbrook Rd.
 Archer Elevator Rd.
 W. Iles Ave.

These are home made traditional micro size caches which hold a log sheet only so please bring your own writing utencil.

This is a series of micro size caches along the Sangamon Valley Bike Trail on the west side of Springfield. Our goal is to make this series go the entire length of the trail. The trail is paved so it will be easy biking or walking to the cache locations but once you get to the destination you will find you have a little bit of bushwacking and some rough footing to actually get to the cache with the exception of a couple of them. These should be fairly easy to spot once you get close. Please be aware there may be some poisonous plants or your may get a ticks or two as you will be in the wooded area looking for these caches.

This cache owner:
- Maintains thier own caches. Please advise if there is a problem.
- If you find the coords to be way off please email them to me and I will update them
- Appreciates logs that are not cut and pasted :) Be creative
- As always PLEASE be careful out there

Good luck and Happy hunting!!!!

Congrats to C.A.C.H.E.R. X on the FTF!!!!

Set off with QuicVic and the Griffin14 clan with the mission to do the bike trail in Springfield and then spend the rest of the day picking up anything else we could. It was the perfect day for a bike ride except for some strong wind gusts near the end. We found a few of these on the ground and returned to their mostly likely host. TFTCSL</groundspeak:text>

Find the cache; sign the log; find the letter stamp inside the cache and stamp a piece of paper as proof that you have found the cache.  Do NOT take the letter stamp from the cache – please replace in the cache for the next cacher to find! Once you have found all of the “Words With Cachers” letters / caches that you can, come to the event to be held at 5:30 and show off your Scrabble skills by creating the word with the most points! &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
As a special bonus, there are two extra letter stickers in each cache.  The first and second-to-find cachers can take one sticker each to increase the letters that they have found.  Again, please take only one letter sticker if you are the first to find.&lt;br /&gt;

We were glad to see the high water bridge because the low water bridge was impassible.  At the coordinates Roelsch scored the quick smiley.  Took nothing and left nothing.

We logged caches as "MG/TR/RO" to be brief. I plotted a series of "bugle notes" to get us to the relevant trail intersections and the bridge over Archer creek (which we REALLY needed today). The cache itself was an immediate find from 30' away. Thanks, spinetingler, for placing this cache! -- roelsch, Saint Charles, MO.</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Found this one a couple days ago….Very neat place.  I talked to the extremely nice owners/operators of the farm and asked if could be possible to place more out here.  Not understanding exactly what geocaching is, they didn't say NO…. but wasn't granted permission.  Would be a great walking series.  Reminds me of the walk to Illinois's oldest geocache….Beverly.  If more are placed out here, I recommend that the container is a little more hidden.  Muggles walk these trails and the container is in plain sight,  Well worth the walk.  Hope to come back here again…

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Sangamon Valley Trail
 
Distance: 5.5 Miles
 
The Sangamon Valley Trail is a mostly shaded route that takes travelers from Stuart Park on the northwest side of town to Centennial Park on the southwest side. The trail includes scenic bridges over highway 97, Washington St, and Old Jacksonville Rd. Additionally, there is a bridge over the valley between Highway 97 and Washington St. Future expansion includes extending the trail north to Athens and South to Girard.
 
Trail Head:
 Stuart Park (parking lot)
 Centennial Park (parking lot)
 
Residential Access:
 Harrison Park Subdivision
 Meadowbrook Rd.
 Archer Elevator Rd.
 W. Iles Ave.

These are home made traditional micro size caches which hold a log sheet only so please bring your own writing utencil.

This is a series of micro size caches along the Sangamon Valley Bike Trail on the west side of Springfield. Our goal is to make this series go the entire length of the trail. The trail is paved so it will be easy biking or walking to the cache locations but once you get to the destination you will find you have a little bit of bushwacking and some rough footing to actually get to the cache with the exception of a couple of them. These should be fairly easy to spot once you get close. Please be aware there may be some poisonous plants or your may get a ticks or two as you will be in the wooded area looking for these caches.

This cache owner:
- Maintains thier own caches. Please advise if there is a problem.
- If you find the coords to be way off please email them to me and I will update them
- Appreciates logs that are not cut and pasted :) Be creative
- As always PLEASE be careful out there

Good luck and Happy hunting!!!!


Congrats to C.A.C.H.E.R. X on the FTF!!!!

Distance: 5.5 Miles
 
The Sangamon Valley Trail is a mostly shaded route that takes travelers from Stuart Park on the northwest side of town to Centennial Park on the southwest side. The trail includes scenic bridges over highway 97, Washington St, and Old Jacksonville Rd. Additionally, there is a bridge over the valley between Highway 97 and Washington St. Future expansion includes extending the trail north to Athens and South to Girard.
 
Trail Head:
 Stuart Park (parking lot)
 Centennial Park (parking lot)
 
Residential Access:
 Harrison Park Subdivision
 Meadowbrook Rd.
 Archer Elevator Rd.
 W. Iles Ave.

These are home made traditional micro size caches which hold a log sheet only so please bring your own writing utencil.

This is a series of micro size caches along the Sangamon Valley Bike Trail on the west side of Springfield. Our goal is to make this series go the entire length of the trail. The trail is paved so it will be easy biking or walking to the cache locations but once you get to the destination you will find you have a little bit of bushwacking and some rough footing to actually get to the cache with the exception of a couple of them. These should be fairly easy to spot once you get close. Please be aware there may be some poisonous plants or your may get a ticks or two as you will be in the wooded area looking for these caches.

This cache owner:
- Maintains thier own caches. Please advise if there is a problem.
- If you find the coords to be way off please email them to me and I will update them
- Appreciates logs that are not cut and pasted :) Be creative
- As always PLEASE be careful out there

Good luck and Happy hunting!!!!


Congrats to C.A.C.H.E.R. X on the FTF!!!!

It is in a pillbottle and is hidden in a log. It contains only log and a small pencil. Might want to bring a pencil just in case. In the summer, the area gets overgrown and might be hard to find. In case you might be wondering, the cache is not in private property. This area used to be a playground.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I loved this cache (even though I had to visit it twice).  The first time was a whim, mainly to get my grandson to take a walk with me and I had not read the description very well.  The second visit was a "mercy cache" , my wife who no longer caches said "why don't you go back and do it" after an early store run this morning.

The cache was wonderful: poison ivy, thorn bushes, limbs that scrape your head (even though you are bent over), GPS coordinates that are good - but deteriorate quickly when you take one step, and a nice dark surrounding due to vegetation.  The only thing missing were the bugs.  That make it a perfect "woods cache" even though the bypass traffic is only 30 feet away.  I had a lot of fun and this gets a favorite vote from me.

Distance: 5.5 Miles
 
The Sangamon Valley Trail is a mostly shaded route that takes travelers from Stuart Park on the northwest side of town to Centennial Park on the southwest side. The trail includes scenic bridges over highway 97, Washington St, and Old Jacksonville Rd. Additionally, there is a bridge over the valley between Highway 97 and Washington St. Future expansion includes extending the trail north to Athens and South to Girard.
 
Trail Head:
 Stuart Park (parking lot)
 Centennial Park (parking lot)
 
Residential Access:
 Harrison Park Subdivision
 Meadowbrook Rd.
 Archer Elevator Rd.
 W. Iles Ave.

These are home made traditional micro size caches which hold a log sheet only so please bring your own writing utencil.

This is a series of micro size caches along the Sangamon Valley Bike Trail on the west side of Springfield. Our goal is to make this series go the entire length of the trail. The trail is paved so it will be easy biking or walking to the cache locations but once you get to the destination you will find you have a little bit of bushwacking and some rough footing to actually get to the cache with the exception of a couple of them. These should be fairly easy to spot once you get close. Please be aware there may be some poisonous plants or your may get a ticks or two as you will be in the wooded area looking for these caches.

This cache owner:
- Maintains thier own caches. Please advise if there is a problem.
- If you find the coords to be way off please email them to me and I will update them
- Appreciates logs that are not cut and pasted :) Be creative
- As always PLEASE be careful out there

Good luck and Happy hunting!!!!


Congrats to C.A.C.H.E.R. X on the FTF!!!!

This is one in a series of caches along the lick creek wildlife preserve trail.
Bring a hiking stick or mountain bike. Invest in some Deet. The terrain is steep and rocky at times. The total trail is about 1 mile and connects on the other side to the Chatham inter-urban biking trail.
This is a great chance to get many caches and hike or bike in the woods. The biking is technical and difficult. This is one of the best mountain biking trails in the area.
The trees are thick and the signal gets bad, so I will try to give good hints.
If you have a better GPS than mine, feel free to e-mail the better coordinates. I’ll average them out and update the coordinates if I’m way off.

Parking can be reached by going down woodside road and turning South on Chatham road.

Note: Each cache in the LICK series has an extra note on the laminated card (ex. a=3). Ignore that. It was for a multi-cache plan that didn't work out.</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Beginning this sport in Georgia, I quickly became spoiled. There were tons of quick and easy to find smileys within 15 minutes of where I lived. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the long hike to get one or two smileys sometimes. But then there are times when I might only have 30 to 45 minutes with which to dedicate to caching. Even though this series won't help me with some quick ones, it will give others that opportunity. And hopefully others might get excited about putting more caches out. You never know, Springfield might even become a caching destination. OK, maybe that IS stretching it a bit with that last line. Sorry!

This cache is not quite a drive-by. You can usually park about 20' away but during the day, those parking spots may be taken. This one can be searched for at night but might be a bit tough. The cache is just "hangin' around" waiting for someone to find it.

Distance: 5.5 Miles
 
The Sangamon Valley Trail is a mostly shaded route that takes travelers from Stuart Park on the northwest side of town to Centennial Park on the southwest side. The trail includes scenic bridges over highway 97, Washington St, and Old Jacksonville Rd. Additionally, there is a bridge over the valley between Highway 97 and Washington St. Future expansion includes extending the trail north to Athens and South to Girard.
 
Trail Head:
 Stuart Park (parking lot)
 Centennial Park (parking lot)
 
Residential Access:
 Harrison Park Subdivision
 Meadowbrook Rd.
 Archer Elevator Rd.
 W. Iles Ave.

These are home made traditional micro size caches which hold a log sheet only so please bring your own writing utencil.

This is a series of micro size caches along the Sangamon Valley Bike Trail on the west side of Springfield. Our goal is to make this series go the entire length of the trail. The trail is paved so it will be easy biking or walking to the cache locations but once you get to the destination you will find you have a little bit of bushwacking and some rough footing to actually get to the cache with the exception of a couple of them. These should be fairly easy to spot once you get close. Please be aware there may be some poisonous plants or your may get a ticks or two as you will be in the wooded area looking for these caches.

This cache owner:
- Maintains thier own caches. Please advise if there is a problem.
- If you find the coords to be way off please email them to me and I will update them
- Appreciates logs that are not cut and pasted :) Be creative
- As always PLEASE be careful out there

Good luck and Happy hunting!!!!


Congrats to C.A.C.H.E.R. X on the FTF!!!!

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This is one in a series of caches along the lick creek wildlife preserve trail.
Bring a hiking stick or mountain bike. Invest in some Deet. The terrain is steep and rocky at times. The total trail is about 1 mile and connects on the other side to the Chatham inter-urban biking trail.
This is a great chance to get many caches and hike or bike in the woods. The biking is technical and difficult. This is one of the best mountain biking trails in the area.
The trees are thick and the signal gets bad, so I will try to give good hints.
If you have a better GPS than mine, feel free to e-mail the better coordinates. I’ll average them out and update the coordinates if I’m way off.
There is really no need to touch anything itchy or green.

Parking can be reached by starting at Lick Rail.</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This is our first hide. Two years ago, before a trip to Branson, Mo, plain.film asked if I wanted to check out this geocaching I had mentioned previously. Our first four caches were located near this trail. (A trail we did not know existed and one of many discoveries that have been made bc of geocaching). A few days later we were exploring parts of Branson we did not know existed. The original container was found that weekend in an antique store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;We wanted to hide a cache before plain.film moved to Indianapolis for the next step in her career. In honor of our careers in radiology, there is a fish bones travel coin. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Replaced original container before it rusted shut. Try not to shove log too far into it as it may be hard to get out. BYOP&lt;br /&gt;

Distance: 5.5 Miles
 
The Sangamon Valley Trail is a mostly shaded route that takes travelers from Stuart Park on the northwest side of town to Centennial Park on the southwest side. The trail includes scenic bridges over highway 97, Washington St, and Old Jacksonville Rd. Additionally, there is a bridge over the valley between Highway 97 and Washington St. Future expansion includes extending the trail north to Athens and South to Girard.
 
Trail Head:
 Stuart Park (parking lot)
 Centennial Park (parking lot)
 
Residential Access:
 Harrison Park Subdivision
 Meadowbrook Rd.
 Archer Elevator Rd.
 W. Iles Ave.

These are home made traditional micro size caches which hold a log sheet only so please bring your own writing utencil.

This is a series of micro size caches along the Sangamon Valley Bike Trail on the west side of Springfield. Our goal is to make this series go the entire length of the trail. The trail is paved so it will be easy biking or walking to the cache locations but once you get to the destination you will find you have a little bit of bushwacking and some rough footing to actually get to the cache with the exception of a couple of them. These should be fairly easy to spot once you get close. Please be aware there may be some poisonous plants or your may get a ticks or two as you will be in the wooded area looking for these caches.

This cache owner:
- Maintains thier own caches. Please advise if there is a problem.
- If you find the coords to be way off please email them to me and I will update them
- Appreciates logs that are not cut and pasted :) Be creative
- As always PLEASE be careful out there

Good luck and Happy hunting!!!!


Congrats to C.A.C.H.E.R. X on the FTF!!!!

You'll want to park at N 39° 47.763' W 89° 43.091' and take the trail right near the playground.
This is our first cache. It is in a large black GNC container

Please rehide it and cover it well. 

Make sure to visit all 4 caches in these woods (MAD kids cache, okey pokey, hokey pokey on koke and cd exchange) You will get your bang for you buck out of these 4 regular size caches. No wimpy ol' micros here)</groundspeak:long_description>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Geocaching with Mean Gene and The Rooter in Springfield on an unseasonably warm Memorial Day weekend. The second of four in this area. We had no sooner found this cache then we met Kurt (aka [i]Team Cougar Pride[/i]) who was also hunting caches along this trail, and who told us that his parents (Pengyou) were waiting to meet us, back at the van. We were surprised that they knew who we were or that we were here, but I guess they put two and two together from having seen our van in the parking lot and  from our previous correspondence and cache logs, so they figured out who we were.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Fellow Geocaches lace up your walking shoes or hiking boots, get your bicycles out and go after this series of 12 caches located along the Interurban Trail. Depending on where you park the walk or bike ride may be longer or shorter but you will be taking quite a hike or ride no matter where you decide to park. This series is made up of homemade traditional containers which only hold log sheets with a few of them big enough to hold small swag Please remember to bring a writing utencil with you to sign the logs. A couple of these may need an extraction tool to get the log sheet out of the container. They are all fairly easy finds being just off the paved trail but a couple of them may be a little harder to spot than others. So be ready to get some exercise and as always Good Luck and Happy Hunting !!!!!</groundspeak:long_description>

This is one in a series of caches along the lick creek wildlife preserve trail.
Bring a hiking stick or mountain bike. Invest in some Deet. The terrain is steep and rocky at times. The total trail is about 1 mile and connects on the other side to the Chatham inter-urban biking trail.
This is a great chance to get many caches and hike or bike in the woods. The biking is technical and difficult. This is one of the best mountain biking trails in the area.
The trees are thick and the signal gets bad, so I will try to give good hints.
If you have a better GPS than mine, feel free to e-mail the better coordinates. I’ll average them out and update the coordinates if I’m way off.

Parking can be reached by starting at Lick Rail.</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">You're be looking for a micro located in Springfield, Illinois.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">The micro is a strange little device that I got when I was buying some new batteries for my GPSr, so I thought I would make it into a cache. The coppertop battery people included with the batteries this device that is a combination whistle and compass that includes a secret (well, it's not too secret) compartment for storing small things. Oh yeah, it's got a mirror too, in case you have to signal a circling aircraft I guess. In this case, the not so secret compartment is storing a cache log. You will have to bring your own pencil.

So find the cache, check for directions on the compass (it doesn't work very well), blow the whistle (it's not a very pretty sound), admire yourself in the mirror (if you're very small) and open the (not so) secret compartment and sign the log.

No attempt has been made to camouflage this one, but it's not hidden in an easy place to find it either.

You can park close to the cache. There is a playground and baseball field close by, but both are seldom in use.</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Fellow Geocaches lace up your walking shoes or hiking boots, get your bicycles out and go after this series of 12 caches located along the Interurban Trail. Depending on where you park the walk or bike ride may be longer or shorter but you will be taking quite a hike or ride no matter where you decide to park. This series is made up of homemade traditional containers which only hold log sheets with a few of them big enough to hold small swag Please remember to bring a writing utencil with you to sign the logs. A couple of these may need an extraction tool to get the log sheet out of the container. They are all fairly easy finds being just off the paved trail but a couple of them may be a little harder to spot than others. So be ready to get some exercise and as always Good Luck and Happy Hunting !!!!!</groundspeak:long_description>

You do not have to park on Wabash Ave. to get to the hidey spot. It is located near one of the parking spots for the Wabash Bike Trail. It is going to be hard to spot but with a little luck you will make the find and get a smiley on this one. I went out and made this one a little easier with a larger container but it still may be hard to spot. This cache is a homemade traditional cache that holds a log sheet only so please bring a writing utencil to sign the log.

Millie somtime can help but not on are teem.Where goin to put this out by taylorv=20ille where Pop growed up, but no we were in town here and liked spot so we droped here. Pop would have stood here figuring the deer hunt possible here.Road was closed when we started doing this stuff and that might be a helpfull clue. Road Closed. And look for fire. Haha. Pope never figured there was a O in it, because he always called this gcaching. So thats the name. We got out 4 gcatchs now but 2 or gone now. We wanna put out1 or 2more soon. May be even more.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Fellow Geocaches lace up your walking shoes or hiking boots, get your bicycles out and go after this series of 12 caches located along the Interurban Trail. Depending on where you park the walk or bike ride may be longer or shorter but you will be taking quite a hike or ride no matter where you decide to park. This series is made up of homemade traditional containers which only hold log sheets with a few of them big enough to hold small swag Please remember to bring a writing utencil with you to sign the logs. A couple of these may need an extraction tool to get the log sheet out of the container. They are all fairly easy finds being just off the paved trail but a couple of them may be a little harder to spot than others. So be ready to get some exercise and as always Good Luck and Happy Hunting !!!!!

Distance: 5.5 Miles
 
The Sangamon Valley Trail is a mostly shaded route that takes travelers from Stuart Park on the northwest side of town to Centennial Park on the southwest side. The trail includes scenic bridges over highway 97, Washington St, and Old Jacksonville Rd. Additionally, there is a bridge over the valley between Highway 97 and Washington St. Future expansion includes extending the trail north to Athens and South to Girard.
 
Trail Head:
 Stuart Park (parking lot)
 Centennial Park (parking lot)
 
Residential Access:
 Harrison Park Subdivision
 Meadowbrook Rd.
 Archer Elevator Rd.
 W. Iles Ave.

These are home made traditional micro size caches which hold a log sheet only so please bring your own writing utencil.

This is a series of micro size caches along the Sangamon Valley Bike Trail on the west side of Springfield. Our goal is to make this series go the entire length of the trail. The trail is paved so it will be easy biking or walking to the cache locations but once you get to the destination you will find you have a little bit of bushwacking and some rough footing to actually get to the cache with the exception of a couple of them. These should be fairly easy to spot once you get close. Please be aware there may be some poisonous plants or your may get a ticks or two as you will be in the wooded area looking for these caches.

This cache owner:
- Maintains thier own caches. Please advise if there is a problem.
- If you find the coords to be way off please email them to me and I will update them
- Appreciates logs that are not cut and pasted :) Be creative
- As always PLEASE be careful out there

Good luck and Happy hunting!!!!


Congrats to C.A.C.H.E.R. X on the FTF!!!!

This cache could possibly be considered a P &amp; G being close to parking and is accessable to everyone. This is a very family friendly cache. Beware because at times there are alot of muggles around this spot. Please cover cache the same way as you find it. This is our first hide so we hope everyone has a good time. 

This cache owner:
- Maintains thier own caches. Please advise if there is a problem.
- Appreciates logs that are not cut and pasted :) Be creative

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This is one in a series of caches along the lick creek wildlife preserve trail.
Bring a hiking stick or mountain bike. Invest in some Deet. The terrain is steep and rocky at times. The total trail is about 1 mile and connects on the other side to the Chatham inter-urban biking trail.
This is a great chance to get many caches and hike or bike in the woods. The biking is technical and difficult. This is one of the best mountain biking trails in the area.
The trees are thick and the signal gets bad, so I will try to give good hints.
If you have a better GPS than mine, feel free to e-mail the better coordinates. I’ll average them out and update the coordinates if I’m way off.

Parking can be reached by going down woodside road and turning South on Chatham road. The road ends at a CWLP station and bridge. (see Lick Rail) for coordinates)</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Fellow Geocaches lace up your walking shoes or hiking boots, get your bicycles out and go after this series of 12 caches located along the Interurban Trail. Depending on where you park the walk or bike ride may be longer or shorter but you will be taking quite a hike or ride no matter where you decide to park. This series is made up of homemade traditional containers which only hold log sheets with a few of them big enough to hold small swag Please remember to bring a writing utencil with you to sign the logs. A couple of these may need an extraction tool to get the log sheet out of the container. They are all fairly easy finds being just off the paved trail but a couple of them may be a little harder to spot than others. So be ready to get some exercise and as always Good Luck and Happy Hunting !!!!!

The cache is not too far off of the trail. Since the trail is very popular, please be discrete. I spent so long on this cache, I wouldn't want it to be muggled or fall victim to the elements.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Geocaching in Springfield and Decatur on the last day of June with Mean Gene and The Rooter. There is construction taking place where we had planned to park, so we had to make some adjustments to our route, but the net result was about the same: we had a nice walk down the busy bike trail (all kinds of bikers, and one roller-blader), then the traffic abated while we were looking for the cache. The GPS had us looking on the wrong side of the trail for a few minutes, but once I got to the correct side, it was an easy find. Note to owner: the Velcro isn't working very well [:(]. TNLNSL.

We decided we wanted to camelfladge it by putting it by other concrete so we’re using a spot we have used before one where there is other comcrete. We hope no ome steels this one like last time.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Beginning this sport in Georgia, I quickly became spoiled. There were tons of quick and easy to find smileys within 15 minutes of where I lived. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the long hike to get one or two smileys sometimes. But then there are times when I might only have 30 to 45 minutes with which to dedicate to caching. Even though this series won't help ME with some quick ones, it will give others that opportunity. And hopefully others might get excited about putting more caches out. You never know, Springfield might even become a caching destination. OK, maybe that IS stretching it a bit with that last line. Sorry! 

Finding this micro shouldn't present any problems. Not too many places to hide one here. If the coords seem to be off for any of you, please let me know. For some reason, every reading I took varied a bit. The coords listed seemed to work the best. The cache is not hidden real well but still shouldn't be muggled. There was natural covering placed on top at time of placement. As always, use stealth while searching. Hope you enjoy the smiley.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Sangamon Valley Trail
 
Distance: 5.5 Miles
 
The Sangamon Valley Trail is a mostly shaded route that takes travelers from Stuart Park on the northwest side of town to Centennial Park on the southwest side. The trail includes scenic bridges over highway 97, Washington St, and Old Jacksonville Rd. Additionally, there is a bridge over the valley between Highway 97 and Washington St. Future expansion includes extending the trail north to Athens and South to Girard.
 
Trail Head:
 Stuart Park (parking lot)
 Centennial Park (parking lot)
 
Residential Access:
 Harrison Park Subdivision
 Meadowbrook Rd.
 Archer Elevator Rd.
 W. Iles Ave.

These are home made traditional micro size caches which hold a log sheet only so please bring your own writing utencil.

This is a series of micro size caches along the Sangamon Valley Bike Trail on the west side of Springfield. Our goal is to make this series go the entire length of the trail. The trail is paved so it will be easy biking or walking to the cache locations but once you get to the destination you will find you have a little bit of bushwacking and some rough footing to actually get to the cache with the exception of a couple of them. These should be fairly easy to spot once you get close. Please be aware there may be some poisonous plants or your may get a ticks or two as you will be in the wooded area looking for these caches.

This cache owner:
- Maintains thier own caches. Please advise if there is a problem.
- If you find the coords to be way off please email them to me and I will update them
- Appreciates logs that are not cut and pasted :) Be creative
- As always PLEASE be careful out there

Good luck and Happy hunting!!!!

Congrats to C.A.C.H.E.R. X on the FTF!!!!</groundspeak:long_description>

Set off with QuicVic and the Griffin14 clan with the mission to do the bike trail in Springfield and then spend the rest of the day picking up anything else we could. It was the perfect day for a bike ride except for some strong wind gusts near the end. We found a few of these on the ground and returned to their mostly likely host. TFTCSL</groundspeak:text>

My GPS was all over the place due to the rain soaked foliage.  I eventually spotted the cache from a distance.  The cache was well named because there was PI everywhere.  Fortunately, I took immunization treatments as a kid and am now immune.  Took nothing and left nothing.  Signed log MG,TR and RO for brevity.  Good job.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Geocaching with Mean Gene and The Rooter on another route to Springfield, IL, this time with steady rain for more than half of the day. We logged caches as "MG/TR/RO" to be brief. The TomTom GPS doesn't have a road in its map that connects from Hazel Dell to the parking lot, so the TomTom thought we should park to the south where the trail intersects Woodside Road and hike in from there.... Sigh. 

We navigated by dead reckoning to the parking lot and hiked to the cache from the north, spotting a passing train along the way. Once near GZ, Mean Gene found a path into the underbrush and spotted the cache soon thereafter.

The Rooter found a patch of strawberries near where Mean Gene headed into the underbrush.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Fellow Geocaches lace up your walking shoes or hiking boots, get your bicycles out and go after this series of 12 caches located along the Interurban Trail. Depending on where you park the walk or bike ride may be longer or shorter but you will be taking quite a hike or ride no matter where you decide to park. This series is made up of homemade traditional containers which only hold log sheets with a few of them big enough to hold small swag Please remember to bring a writing utencil with you to sign the logs. A couple of these may need an extraction tool to get the log sheet out of the container. They are all fairly easy finds being just off the paved trail but a couple of them may be a little harder to spot than others. So be ready to get some exercise and as always Good Luck and Happy Hunting !!!!!</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Fellow Geocaches lace up your walking shoes or hiking boots, get your bicycles out and go after this series of 12 caches located along the Interurban Trail. Depending on where you park the walk or bike ride may be longer or shorter but you will be taking quite a hike or ride no matter where you decide to park. This series is made up of homemade traditional containers which only hold log sheets with a few of them big enough to hold small swag Please remember to bring a writing utencil with you to sign the logs. A couple of these may need an extraction tool to get the log sheet out of the container. They are all fairly easy finds being just off the paved trail but a couple of them may be a little harder to spot than others. So be ready to get some exercise and as always Good Luck and Happy Hunting !!!!!</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Beginning this sport in Georgia, I quickly became spoiled. There were tons of quick and easy to find smileys within 15 minutes of where I lived. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the long hike to get one or two smileys sometimes. But then there are times when I might only have 30 to 45 minutes with which to dedicate to caching. Even though this series won't help ME with some quick ones, it will give others that opportunity. And hopefully others might get excited about putting more caches out. You never know, Springfield might even become a caching destination. OK, maybe that IS stretching it a bit with that last line. Sorry! 

The location of this cache is so easy, it's just plain SILLY! The hardest part of this cache will be finding it without muggles spotting you. Just another one of this NQEM(nice quick easy micro)! Come find and enjoy your smiley.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Geocaching with Mean Gene and The Rooter on a blustery Fall day, the last day of Daylight Savings Time for the year. Mean Gene and The Rooter had done this long ago, so it never made it onto our Springfield route until this trip. 

We had a pleasant walk down the trail from the nearest parking area, and only saw one biker out, heading the other way. Nice trail -- makes me wish I had a bike again.... We cut into the woods a little later than we might have done, and backtracked just a bit to get to the cache. Found the cache easily and looked up Mean Gene's original log: "Nice cache; easy find." I signed the same way [;)], and we were on our way to the next adventure. TNLNSL. Thanks, Conch &amp; Itchy! roelsch -- St. Charles, MO.

Started our day in this beautiful park and have been pretty lucky in finding what we were looking for,  As we approached GZ here  I noticed what we were looking for and at the same time, a rather friendly, nosy, and somewhat obese squirrel noticed us.  It seemed as if he were 'guarding' the prize!  He finally allowed us to retrieve it, signed the log and replace as found, but I do believe he was somewhat disappointed that we had no food to offer!  Thanks for the fun!

Set off with QuicVic and the Griffin14 clan with the mission to do the bike trail in Springfield and then spend the rest of the day picking up anything else we could. It was the perfect day for a bike ride except for some strong wind gusts near the end. We found a few of these on the ground and returned to their mostly likely host. TFTCSL</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Sangamon Valley Trail
 
Distance: 5.5 Miles
 
The Sangamon Valley Trail is a mostly shaded route that takes travelers from Stuart Park on the northwest side of town to Centennial Park on the southwest side. The trail includes scenic bridges over highway 97, Washington St, and Old Jacksonville Rd. Additionally, there is a bridge over the valley between Highway 97 and Washington St. Future expansion includes extending the trail north to Athens and South to Girard.
 
Trail Head:
 Stuart Park (parking lot)
 Centennial Park (parking lot)
 
Residential Access:
 Harrison Park Subdivision
 Meadowbrook Rd.
 Archer Elevator Rd.
 W. Iles Ave.

These are home made traditional micro size caches which hold a log sheet only so please bring your own writing utencil.

This is a series of micro size caches along the Sangamon Valley Bike Trail on the west side of Springfield. Our goal is to make this series go the entire length of the trail. The trail is paved so it will be easy biking or walking to the cache locations but once you get to the destination you will find you have a little bit of bushwacking and some rough footing to actually get to the cache with the exception of a couple of them. These should be fairly easy to spot once you get close. Please be aware there may be some poisonous plants or your may get a ticks or two as you will be in the wooded area looking for these caches.

This cache owner:
- Maintains thier own caches. Please advise if there is a problem.
- If you find the coords to be way off please email them to me and I will update them
- Appreciates logs that are not cut and pasted :) Be creative
- As always PLEASE be careful out there

Good luck and Happy hunting!!!!

Congrats to C.A.C.H.E.R. X on the FTF!!!!</groundspeak:long_description>

This was the last one before I got to my car and I tried trusting my gps on the app, then I tried ignoring it (it had been acting up the entire time but at the point seemed to be working ok) I was just about to give up when I took a step away to get a bigger picture and slid down the hill (completely dry!) That's when I knew I needed to come back another day, a trip to the er bc I was caching instead of studying isn't on my list of things to do right before finals week ;) maybe next time!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Sangamon Valley Trail
 
Distance: 5.5 Miles
 
The Sangamon Valley Trail is a mostly shaded route that takes travelers from Stuart Park on the northwest side of town to Centennial Park on the southwest side. The trail includes scenic bridges over highway 97, Washington St, and Old Jacksonville Rd. Additionally, there is a bridge over the valley between Highway 97 and Washington St. Future expansion includes extending the trail north to Athens and South to Girard.
 
Trail Head:
 Stuart Park (parking lot)
 Centennial Park (parking lot)
 
Residential Access:
 Harrison Park Subdivision
 Meadowbrook Rd.
 Archer Elevator Rd.
 W. Iles Ave.

These are home made traditional micro size caches which hold a log sheet only so please bring your own writing utencil.

This is a series of micro size caches along the Sangamon Valley Bike Trail on the west side of Springfield. Our goal is to make this series go the entire length of the trail. The trail is paved so it will be easy biking or walking to the cache locations but once you get to the destination you will find you have a little bit of bushwacking and some rough footing to actually get to the cache with the exception of a couple of them. These should be fairly easy to spot once you get close. Please be aware there may be some poisonous plants or your may get a ticks or two as you will be in the wooded area looking for these caches.

This cache owner:
- Maintains thier own caches. Please advise if there is a problem.
- If you find the coords to be way off please email them to me and I will update them
- Appreciates logs that are not cut and pasted :) Be creative
- As always PLEASE be careful out there

Good luck and Happy hunting!!!!

Congrats to C.A.C.H.E.R. X on the FTF!!!!</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">This is my maiden cache!

I was born and raised in Springfield, having only recently returned.  I spent a good amount of time in Jefferson Park growing up, and was disappointed to find it only had a couple of caches (two of which are nowhere to be found).  I had been wanting to place caches of my own, and thought what better place to start than were I learned my love of the outdoors.  I thought it might help to keep Jefferson Park popular, as well.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">I decided to keep things simple, this being my first time.  The cache is on park terrain so it is accessible to anyone, and its size makes its finding easy.  It is in an old Nalgene bottle honoring a personal rolemodel of mine (hopefully, soon to be one of yours too).  I am using this cache as a trial-run to see what kind of activity it gets, so I can decide whether to place more here.  Either way, however, I assure you there will be More To Come...

Jefferson Park is owned and managed by the Springfield Park District so it closes at 10:30pm.  Also, you should keep your pets leashed since often times children are present, given the park's two ballfields and nice playground.  I would like to see Jefferson Park remain family-oriented so I started the cache with small toys.  Enjoy the park, and help keep it clean.</groundspeak:long_description>
      <groundspeak:encoded_hints>My personal rolemodel once said, "UNLESS someone like you cares a whole aweful lot, nothing is going to get better.  It's not."

Distance: 5.5 Miles
 
The Sangamon Valley Trail is a mostly shaded route that takes travelers from Stuart Park on the northwest side of town to Centennial Park on the southwest side. The trail includes scenic bridges over highway 97, Washington St, and Old Jacksonville Rd. Additionally, there is a bridge over the valley between Highway 97 and Washington St. Future expansion includes extending the trail north to Athens and South to Girard.
 
Trail Head:
 Stuart Park (parking lot)
 Centennial Park (parking lot)
 
Residential Access:
 Harrison Park Subdivision
 Meadowbrook Rd.
 Archer Elevator Rd.
 W. Iles Ave.

These are home made traditional micro size caches which hold a log sheet only so please bring your own writing utencil.

This is a series of micro size caches along the Sangamon Valley Bike Trail on the west side of Springfield. Our goal is to make this series go the entire length of the trail. The trail is paved so it will be easy biking or walking to the cache locations but once you get to the destination you will find you have a little bit of bushwacking and some rough footing to actually get to the cache with the exception of a couple of them. These should be fairly easy to spot once you get close. Please be aware there may be some poisonous plants or your may get a ticks or two as you will be in the wooded area looking for these caches.

This cache owner:
- Maintains thier own caches. Please advise if there is a problem.
- If you find the coords to be way off please email them to me and I will update them
- Appreciates logs that are not cut and pasted :) Be creative
- As always PLEASE be careful out there

Good luck and Happy hunting!!!!

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">A geocache located where I once pitched my tent, some twenty years
ago. Family-friendly and easy access from a park, not from private
property.</groundspeak:short_description>

height="200" align="left" hspace="5" /&gt;This geocache is in my old
stomping grounds. I grew up near here and, although I didn't
venture into these woods very often, I spent a lot of time at this
park. This is where I first learned (the hard way) what "stranded
on third base" meant. I also launched&amp;mdash; lost&amp;mdash;my first
model rocket here. It's white with red and blue decals, in case you
find it. Last seen around 1980. I've also done some cross-country
skiing here. But on the night in question, I pitched my pup tent
very near spot where this geocache is hidden. I'm not sure how many
people get to this spot, so I've hidden it pretty well. I hope.
&lt;p&gt;You'll want to park somewhere near &lt;b&gt;N 39° 48.355' W 89°
41.995'&lt;/b&gt;. Look for a small social trail; if you come to an old
wire fence, walk around the end of it. The geocache is not on the
social trail and is a bit precarious in its position. You are
looking for a &lt;strike&gt;.30 cal ammo can, with a geocaching.com
label&lt;/strike&gt; green wet wipe box stuffed into a hiding spot.
Please rehide it well! The &lt;a rel="nofollow" href=

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Sangamon Valley Trail
 
Distance: 5.5 Miles
 
The Sangamon Valley Trail is a mostly shaded route that takes travelers from Stuart Park on the northwest side of town to Centennial Park on the southwest side. The trail includes scenic bridges over highway 97, Washington St, and Old Jacksonville Rd. Additionally, there is a bridge over the valley between Highway 97 and Washington St. Future expansion includes extending the trail north to Athens and South to Girard.
 
Trail Head:
 Stuart Park (parking lot)
 Centennial Park (parking lot)
 
Residential Access:
 Harrison Park Subdivision
 Meadowbrook Rd.
 Archer Elevator Rd.
 W. Iles Ave.

These are home made traditional micro size caches which hold a log sheet only so please bring your own writing utencil.


This is a series of micro size caches along the Sangamon Valley Bike Trail on the west side of Springfield. Our goal is to make this series go the entire length of the trail. The trail is paved so it will be easy biking or walking to the cache locations but once you get to the destination you will find you have a little bit of bushwacking and some rough footing to actually get to the cache with the exception of a couple of them. These should be fairly easy to spot once you get close. Please be aware there may be some plants with stickers or your may get a tick or two as you will be in the wooded area looking for these caches andsome require a little bushwacking.

This cache owner:
- Maintains thier own caches. Please advise if there is a problem.
- If you find the coords to be way off please email them to me and I will update them
- Appreciates logs that are not cut and pasted :) Be creative
- As always PLEASE be careful out there

Congrats to Mrori and X on the Co. FTF!!!!

Good luck and Happy hunting!!!!

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;ULTIMATE GUY COMEDY MOVIES&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve decided to create a series of caches based on lines from the ULTIMATE GUY COMEDY MOVIES! Women may or may not like these, but to be considered a real man, you need to have seen each of these movies (often several times). To meet the requirements, the movie has to have stood the test of time (be at least 10 years old) and be a great movie for guys (sorry ladies, but we don’t always get into those “romantic comedies”). You can keep Hugh Grant, give me Mel Brooks or John Belushi any day!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These will not be at the exact location, but will be somewhere nearby. To find it, you have to figure out the movie which will then give you the exact coordinates. Once you find it, you will need to provide your own writing instrument and log it. Finally, when you get home, you may have these lines stuck in your head and might feel an overwhelming urge to watch the move again (for the 142nd time). Feel free to give into these urges!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coordinates:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N 39 47.1A&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;W 89 40.B3&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A = the third number of the year the movie was released&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B = the second number of the year the movie was released minus the first and third number of the year the movie was released&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;i&gt;Why here? - Looks like a place Mr. Hand would go shopping.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Sangamon Valley Trail
 
Distance: 5.5 Miles
 
The Sangamon Valley Trail is a mostly shaded route that takes travelers from Stuart Park on the northwest side of town to Centennial Park on the southwest side. The trail includes scenic bridges over highway 97, Washington St, and Old Jacksonville Rd. Additionally, there is a bridge over the valley between Highway 97 and Washington St. Future expansion includes extending the trail north to Athens and South to Girard.
 
Trail Head:
 Stuart Park (parking lot)
 Centennial Park (parking lot)
 
Residential Access:
 Harrison Park Subdivision
 Meadowbrook Rd.
 Archer Elevator Rd.
 W. Iles Ave.

These are home made traditional micro size caches which hold a log sheet only so please bring your own writing utencil.

This is a series of micro size caches along the Sangamon Valley Bike Trail on the west side of Springfield. Our goal is to make this series go the entire length of the trail. The trail is paved so it will be easy biking or walking to the cache locations but once you get to the destination you will find you have a little bit of bushwacking and some rough footing to actually get to the cache with the exception of a couple of them. These should be fairly easy to spot once you get close. Please be aware there may be some poisonous plants or your may get a tick or two as you will be in the wooded area looking for these caches.

This cache owner:
- Maintains thier own caches. Please advise if there is a problem.
- If you find the coords to be way off please email them to me and I will update them
- Appreciates logs that are not cut and pasted :) Be creative
- As always PLEASE be careful out there

Good luck and Happy hunting!!!!

&lt;font color="blue"&gt;The intent of this series is to point out&lt;br&gt;
historic or unique places along old route 66 between IL and CA.
It&lt;br&gt;
is NOT meant to be a power trail as caches may be 50 miles or
more&lt;br&gt;
apart. Stop and enjoy these sights along the way.&lt;/font&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Welcome to the Route 66 landmark where I both started and ended my
Route 66 vacation. It was wonderful to stay in the old motels, eat
at the old restaurants, and meet many colorful people along the
way. It was, and still is, one of my favorite vacations of all
time! You are looking for a keyholder. &lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
Paraphrasing from "Searching for 66" by Tom Teague, a must-have if
you are trying to drive the Route (as there are driving directions
in the back), the idea for Cozy Dogs was developed by Ed Waldmire,
who was drafted in 1945 and was on a weekend trip from the Amarillo
Air Force Base. He found a little Oklahoma cafe that was making
hotdogs in a waffle iron very slowly. Ed wanted to speed up the
process and came up with the current version of the Cozy Dog. At
the 1946 Illinois State Fair, Ed Waldmire formally introduced the
Cozy Dog and the rest is history!!&lt;br&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">We placed this cache here because we drive past this location just about everyday and have been looking at this hiding spot for awhile. The cache could be considered a park &amp; grab because it will be very easy to find. This cache would be best searched for during the weekends or after working hours because there are alot of muggles in the area during the weekdays but if you use your stealth abilities and park across the street you can get this one at anytime. This cache is big enough for trade items and travel bugs. 

This cache owner:
- Maintains thier own caches. Please advise if there is a problem.
- Appreciates logs that are not cut and pasted :) Be creative

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This location has been many differnet things through the years. Anybody remember when it was an Eagle store(I think). It was the precursor of the Super Wal-mart, having both groceries and clothing. This location was crying out for a cache and finally got around to placing it.

The cache might be hard to grab without some muggles looking at you funny. But most won't have a clue what you are doing.

Originally I am placing a 35mm film container. If this doesn't work out well, I will change to something sturdier. Make sure to bring your own writing utencil. There is room only for the log sheet.

(i always pick the best mornings to cache. lol). once again we had a blast, and little injuries which is rare for me. lol. the stupid nuvi kept telling us to go down the road leading to retirement trailers, but trish called where to turn in. the kids were out playing in the playground but they were far enough away for us to look. i spotted it after letting my gps settle down, and trish went in for the kill. the cache is in good shape, and is 1 of many on the morning for us. thanks hinckleyquest for the hide, and the smiley for me.</groundspeak:text>

I searched for some history of this old Engine House but couldn&amp;#39;t find anyhing anywhere other than a couple recent pictures. If anyone has any information on this Engine House (when it was built, when it was retired, etc.) please feel free to email me with it so I can add it to the page.&amp;nbsp;The cache is an easy P&amp;amp;G located in the parking lot of the old Engine House. It is placed near a box for retired U.S.A. flags so if you have an old flag you need to retire in the proper way bring it along when you grab this cache. This cache is placed with permission of the owner and can be found at all times. Please be respectful of the property and beware this is a high muggle area so you may need to use some stealth when grabbing the cache. The cache is big enough for some very small swag but only holds a log sheet so please bring a writing utencil to sign as found.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This cache owner:&lt;br /&gt;
- Maintains thier own caches. Please advise if there is a problem.&lt;br /&gt;
- Appreciates logs that are not cut and pasted :) Be creative&lt;br /&gt;

logically without guessing. Enter digits from 1 to 9 into the blank
spaces. Every row must contain one of each digit. So must every
column, as must every 3x3 square.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solve the puzzle,below, to find your missing numbers

Distance: 5.5 Miles
 
The Sangamon Valley Trail is a mostly shaded route that takes travelers from Stuart Park on the northwest side of town to Centennial Park on the southwest side. The trail includes scenic bridges over highway 97, Washington St, and Old Jacksonville Rd. Additionally, there is a bridge over the valley between Highway 97 and Washington St. Future expansion includes extending the trail north to Athens and South to Girard.
 
Trail Head:
 Stuart Park (parking lot)
 Centennial Park (parking lot)
 
Residential Access:
 Harrison Park Subdivision
 Meadowbrook Rd.
 Archer Elevator Rd.
 W. Iles Ave.

These are home made traditional micro size caches which hold a log sheet only so please bring your own writing utencil.

This is a series of micro size caches along the Sangamon Valley Bike Trail on the west side of Springfield. Our goal is to make this series go the entire length of the trail. The trail is paved so it will be easy biking or walking to the cache locations but once you get to the destination you will find you have a little bit of bushwacking and some rough footing to actually get to the cache with the exception of a couple of them. These should be fairly easy to spot once you get close. Please be aware there may be some poisonous plants or your may get a tick or two as you will be in the wooded area looking for these caches.

This cache owner:
- Maintains thier own caches. Please advise if there is a problem.
- If you find the coords to be way off please email them to me and I will update them
- Appreciates logs that are not cut and pasted :) Be creative
- As always PLEASE be careful out there

Good luck and Happy hunting!!!!

Unfortunately, we didn’t check the hours and found it was closed on Sundays.  So we picked up food across the street and ate at a spot within view.  Decided to place a cache that was in sight of where we wanted to eat and where we ended up eating!

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Sangamon Valley Trail
 
Distance: 5.5 Miles
 
The Sangamon Valley Trail is a mostly shaded route that takes travelers from Stuart Park on the northwest side of town to Centennial Park on the southwest side. The trail includes scenic bridges over highway 97, Washington St, and Old Jacksonville Rd. Additionally, there is a bridge over the valley between Highway 97 and Washington St. Future expansion includes extending the trail north to Athens and South to Girard.
 
Trail Head:
 Stuart Park (parking lot)
 Centennial Park (parking lot)
 
Residential Access:
 Harrison Park Subdivision
 Meadowbrook Rd.
 Archer Elevator Rd.
 W. Iles Ave.

These are home made traditional micro size caches which hold a log sheet only so please bring your own writing utencil.

This is a series of micro size caches along the Sangamon Valley Bike Trail on the west side of Springfield. Our goal is to make this series go the entire length of the trail. The trail is paved so it will be easy biking or walking to the cache locations but once you get to the destination you will find you have a little bit of bushwacking and some rough footing to actually get to the cache with the exception of a couple of them. These should be fairly easy to spot once you get close. Please be aware there may be some poisonous plants or your may get a tick or two as you will be in the wooded area looking for these caches.

This cache owner:
- Maintains thier own caches. Please advise if there is a problem.
- If you find the coords to be way off please email them to me and I will update them
- Appreciates logs that are not cut and pasted :) Be creative
- As always PLEASE be careful out there

Good luck and Happy hunting!!!!

When aviation was ending its first quarter century, Lindy was ferrying mail from Saint Louis to Chicago, with stops in Springfield as other cities along the way. People would come out to a field just west of town just to greet this pioneer of the skies. His exploits earned him the nickname "The Lone Eagle."

 Distance: 5.5 Miles

The Sangamon Valley Trail is a mostly shaded route that takes travelers from Stuart Park on the northwest side of town to Centennial Park on the southwest side. The trail includes scenic bridges over highway 97, Washington St, and Old Jacksonville Rd. Additionally, there is a bridge over the valley between Highway 97 and Washington St. Future expansion includes extending the trail north to Athens and South to Girard.

 Trail Head:
 Stuart Park (parking lot)
 Centennial Park (parking lot)

 Residential Access: 
Harrison Park Subdivision
 Meadowbrook Rd.
 Archer Elevator Rd.
 W. Iles Ave. 

These are home made traditional micro size caches which hold a log sheet only so please bring your own writing utencil.

This is a series of micro size caches along the Sangamon Valley Bike Trail on the west side of Springfield. Our goal is to make this series go the entire length of the trail. The trail is paved so it will be easy biking or walking to the cache locations but once you get to the destination you will find you have a little bit of bushwacking and some rough footing to actually get to the cache with the exception of a couple of them. These should be fairly easy to spot once you get close. Please be aware there may be some poisonous plants or your may get a tick or two as you will be in the wooded area looking for these caches.

This cache owner:
- Maintains thier own caches. Please advise if there is a problem.
- If you find the coords to be way off please email them to me and I will update them
- Appreciates logs that are not cut and pasted :) Be creative
- As always PLEASE be careful out there

Good luck and Happy hunting!!!!

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Sangamon Valley Trail

 Distance: 5.5 Miles

The Sangamon Valley Trail is a mostly shaded route that takes travelers from Stuart Park on the northwest side of town to Centennial Park on the southwest side. The trail includes scenic bridges over highway 97, Washington St, and Old Jacksonville Rd. Additionally, there is a bridge over the valley between Highway 97 and Washington St. Future expansion includes extending the trail north to Athens and South to Girard.

 Trail Head:
 Stuart Park (parking lot)
 Centennial Park (parking lot)

 Residential Access: 
Harrison Park Subdivision
 Meadowbrook Rd.
 Archer Elevator Rd.
 W. Iles Ave. 

These are home made traditional micro size caches which hold a log sheet only so please bring your own writing utencil.

This is a series of micro size caches along the Sangamon Valley Bike Trail on the west side of Springfield. Our goal is to make this series go the entire length of the trail. The trail is paved so it will be easy biking or walking to the cache locations but once you get to the destination you will find you have a little bit of bushwacking and some rough footing to actually get to the cache with the exception of a couple of them. These should be fairly easy to spot once you get close. Please be aware there may be some poisonous plants or your may get a tick or two as you will be in the wooded area looking for these caches.

This cache owner:
- Maintains thier own caches. Please advise if there is a problem.
- If you find the coords to be way off please email them to me and I will update them
- Appreciates logs that are not cut and pasted :) Be creative
- As always PLEASE be careful out there

Good luck and Happy hunting!!!!

Congrats to C.A.C.H.E.R. X on the FTF!!!!</groundspeak:long_description>

Two- it is hidden in a way that is not traditionally placed…Checking the most likely spots doesn't work here.  And the biggest reason was I try never to read the hint.  Read the hint.  Cache was found only a couple feet off the trail , but cords wanted me to go much deeper.  Liked the challenge here.  Springfield is once again clqeared for Now!    Thanks Smurfs.

the local cachers.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Therefore since I have been here for 5 days and enjoying the cache
placements, I wanted to place a tribute cache. So here it is: This
cache is just a quick drive up and grab.
&lt;p&gt;This cache has no redeeming features&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no history lesson to learn at this location, I'll let
Searching_ Simpsons take care historic hides..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache does not have a nice view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not a nice Hike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not a great place to put a cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not a cool place you didn't know existed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not a creative container.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is not hidden particularly well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cachehas no redeeming value. Just a smiley to add to your
numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that smile will not be as big as the one I have as I
remember this trip to Springfield. Thanks to jgooose for housing
and feeding me this week. To searching_simpsons for the wonderful
event that she helped jgooose hold in my honor and the awsome tour
of the State Capital and grounds. To MutherAndSun , Super_Cacher,
Fuzzy and Slowpokes for caching with me and showing me the ropes.
And a special thanks to all who came to the event and welcomed me
to Springfield.&lt;/p&gt;

The park is only open certain hours so please read the signs as you are entering. As with all parks in Springfield this park closes at 9:30 P.M. so please limit your search during open hours
</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This is not your typical traditional geocache but it is what I would consider a micro size cache. This cache will be hard to spot in a nice quiet park on the west side of Springfield. The park is only open during until 9:30 pm so make your caching adventure before it closes. Please note the difficulty level of this cache because it might be a hard one for the inexperienced cacher and maybe even for the experienced cacher. The cache is only big enough for a log sheet so please bring your own writing utencil to sign as found.&lt;/p&gt;

If anything was wrong with any cache steph logged it so there isn't any need in me repeating it lol...I'm a lazy logger, it takes me sometimes a few months to log, she's a quick OCD type logger, she logs the same day or first thing the very next day lol...So she always beats me to the punch :)  TFTC!!!!</groundspeak:text>

If anything was wrong with any cache steph logged it so there isn't any need in me repeating it lol...I'm a lazy logger, it takes me sometimes a few months to log, she's a quick OCD type logger, she logs the same day or first thing the very next day lol...So she always beats me to the punch :)  TFTC!!!!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;ULTIMATE GUY COMEDY MOVIES&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve decided to create a series of caches based on lines from the ULTIMATE GUY COMEDY MOVIES! Women may or may not like these, but to be considered a real man, you need to have seen each of these movies (often several times). To meet the requirements, the movie has to have stood the test of time (be at least 10 years old) and be a great movie for guys (sorry ladies, but we don’t always get into those “romantic comedies”). You can keep Hugh Grant, give me Mel Brooks or John Belushi any day!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These will not be at the exact location, but will be somewhere nearby. To find it, you have to figure out the movie which will then give you the exact coordinates. Once you find it, you will need to provide your own writing instrument and log it. Finally, when you get home, you may have these lines stuck in your head and might feel an overwhelming urge to watch the move again (for the 142&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; time). Feel free to give into these urges!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coordinates:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;N 39 46.2AB&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;W 89 37.BC5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A = the third number of the year the movie was released minus the first number of the year the movie was released&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B = the third number of the year the movie was released plus the first number of the year the movie was released&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C = the golfers dream ... a hole in ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;i&gt;Why here? Just look to the west.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

border="1" align="left" hspace="10" /&gt;Have you noticed that, when
approaching Springfield from the interstate, you occasionally see
signs for "Lincoln Sites" rather than "Springfield"? My friend,
Larry Lastchance pointed that out to me many years ago. So in 1989,
I printed up some postcards like the one to the left. Nifty, eh?
The years have rolled on and now it's time for the "Lincoln Sites
Multi-cache" This is the first one. Maybe I'll make a sequel
sometime. Many of these waypoints have little or nothing to do with
Abraham Lincoln, but you'll get to walk where he walked. Surely
that counts for something. The final geocache is about 2 miles from
the starting point, but all of the other parts can be easily
walked. I suggest finding all of the waypoints, then do the first
part of &lt;a href=
"http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?ID=38461"
target="new"&gt;Paul Powell's Shoebox&lt;/a&gt; and finish them both
together.
&lt;p&gt;You'll start at the posted coordinates, which are near Lincoln's
Home. Standing on the north side of the street, you are looking for
the number of windows and chimneys that you can see on his house
from this spot. The partially visible window counts as &lt;b&gt;zero&lt;/b&gt;,
as do the small basement windows. Multiply the number of chimneys
by 2, giving you &lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;. Subtract the number of chimneys from the
number of windows, giving you &lt;b&gt;F&lt;/b&gt;. Now go to waypoint 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Waypoint 2&lt;/b&gt; is found at:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;font size="+1"&gt;N 39° 47.881'
W 89° 38.783'
&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;font face="Verdana" size="2"&gt;You are looking for a plaque near the
door. How many letters are in the friend's first name? That number
is &lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt;. Great! Now you are ready to go to Waypoint 3.&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Verdana" size="2"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Waypoint 3&lt;/b&gt; is found
at:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;font size="+1"&gt;N 39° 47.957'
W 89° 38.808'
&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;font face="Verdana" size="2"&gt;I was hoping to have you find an NGS
benchmark, but it's in the gated parking lot. So find the plaque on
the stone monument by the sidewalk. [NOTE: Plaque is gone. Use 1999
as the year!] The number of "eights" that are in the year equals
&lt;b&gt;G&lt;/b&gt;. Now take the last digit of the year and subtract one,
giving you the value of &lt;b&gt;H&lt;/b&gt;. Incidentally, if you face the
plaque and look southwest (roughly 1 o'clock) through the bars of
the fence, you will &lt;a href=
"http://www.xsnrg.com/images/IMG_0165.jpg" target="new"&gt;see the
benchmark&lt;/a&gt; (a round disk) on a low window ledge. It's probably
the easiest benchmark to find in the Springfield area. If you
haven't been looking for these, be sure to have a look at
geocaching.com's &lt;a href="http://www.geocaching.com/mark" target=
"new"&gt;benchmark&lt;/a&gt; site. You can even log it! Anyway, now it's a
short walk to Waypoint 4.&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Verdana" size="2"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Waypoint 4&lt;/b&gt; is found
at:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;font size="+1"&gt;N 39° 47.997'
W 89° 38.880'
&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;font face="Verdana" size="2"&gt;This storefront, on the south side of
the alley, is where I used to have my copy shop. This is where the
postcards were printed so many years ago. Here is a photo of my
&lt;a href="http://www.xsnrg.com/images/occo.jpg" target=
"new"&gt;Original Copy Company&lt;/a&gt;, circa 1987. At this spot, you'll
need to find out what is the width of the door, in brown tiles.
Take that number, subtract two and you'll have both &lt;b&gt;E&lt;/b&gt; and
&lt;b&gt;J&lt;/b&gt;. Waypoint 5 is just around the corner!&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Verdana" size="2"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Waypoint 5&lt;/b&gt; is found at or
near:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;font size="+1"&gt;N 39° 48.028'
W 89° 38.884'
&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;font face="Verdana" size="2"&gt;No, we're not going to that big,
domed building. We're looking for the building on the corner. See,
there really is some Lincoln stuff in this hunt. Because signal
bounces around here so much, your GPSr may have you anywhere near
the corner. Look for the building that says "Lincoln-Herndon" and
find the plaque on the north side. The plaque mentions a "story"
and the number of the story is &lt;b&gt;C&lt;/b&gt;. It's a bit farther to
waypoint 6, but not too much. You can still walk to it.&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Verdana" size="2"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Construction Zone Work-around
for Waypoint 5&lt;/b&gt;: From there, continue heading west down the
mall. A few doors down is an 'antiquarian bookseller'. Add the
three digits of their address and subtract 6. That will also give
you the value for C. (Stop in and tell John I said
hello!)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Verdana" size="2"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Waypoint 6&lt;/b&gt; is found
at:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;font size="+1"&gt;N 39° 48.046'
W 89° 39.082'
&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;font face="Verdana" size="2"&gt;Were you wondering if I was directing
you to something significant? It sure doesn't look like it. Well,
read that plaque on the big stone. A lot of locals don't even know
about this one. Cool, huh? Jot down the number of children they had
here for &lt;b&gt;D&lt;/b&gt;. There is also a date in May mentioned and you
need that number for &lt;b&gt;I&lt;/b&gt;. Now, you'll want to go get your car
to drive to the final geocache. Plug your numbers into the magic
formula!&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Verdana" size="2"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Final Geocache&lt;/b&gt; is found

&lt;font face="Verdana" size="2"&gt;The container is a .30 cal ammo can
with a geocaching label on it. Please rehide with the label side UP
and cover the geocache carefully! It's near--but not on--a small
social trail. You'll have to walk on the ivy ground cover, so try
to avoid trampling it. Feel free to use the hint!. &lt;a href=

We drove around for a couple of the stops, but finally decided that the best way to do this one would actually be on foot, so The Rooter and I walked while MG negotiated all the one way streets to meet us at the end of the waypoints. 

There was some kind of street fair starting later in the day I guess, so the streets were relatively deserted except for some vendors setting up their stands. We put all the clues together and computed the location of the final waypoint, which we found easily enough. TNLN.

Thanks, Seth!!

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">You will visit both the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library, on
the corner of Jefferson and 6th Street, and the Lincoln Public
Library, on the corner of Capitol Ave. and 7th Street in
Springfield, IL. At the coordinates given you identify information
from objects and then compute the coordinates of the final cache.
The final container is a small Lock-n-Lock which can hold
TBs.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stage 1&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;: (use the coordinates above)
&lt;p&gt;The Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library is a center for
research and study of the life and times of Abraham Lincoln and the
American Civil War. In addition to the Abraham Lincoln research
material, the library also includes material that is useful for
anyone researching his or her genealogy. A large collection of
Civil War era information is also available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Hours of Operation&lt;/u&gt;: MTTF: 9:00-4:30, W 9:00-8:30,
Saturday 9:00-3:30, closed on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the corrdinates given you will find a dedication stone in the
wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Record the following information&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="margin-left: 2em"&gt;AB. Year dedicated _____.
&lt;p&gt;C.&amp;nbsp; Middle initial of individual named _____.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stage 2&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;: N 39° 47.904 W 089° 38.749&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the 'first' Lincoln Library in Springfield and the name
causes a great deal of confusion for out-of-town visitors. This
library has the Sangamon Valley Collection, which is useful when
researching the history of the local area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the coordinates given you will find a statute of Lincoln. The
artist’s name is on the back-right corner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Record the following information:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="margin-left: 2em"&gt;D. First name (initial) _____.
&lt;p&gt;E. The number of letters in the last name _____.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;F. The last letter of the last name _____.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td valign='top'&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stage 3&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Parking at N 39° 47.412 W 089° 40.626&lt;br /&gt;
 [Do not park on road sides, thanks!]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the information collected above and the decoding table,
find the coordinates of the last stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While searching for the cache, stay on trails – there is no need
to walk on the vegetation (ivy). The cache is within 5-10 feet of
the trail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cache is at N 39 47.ABC W 089 40.DEF, where:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="margin-left: 2em"&gt;AB = Four-digit year divided by 54
(use the integer part only)
&lt;p&gt;C&amp;nbsp; = convert the letter using the table below&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D&amp;nbsp; = convert the letter using the table below&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E&amp;nbsp; = number of letters&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;F&amp;nbsp; = convert the letter using the table below&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td colspan="10"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lincoln Decoder Key&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;E&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;B&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;O&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;N&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;P&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;T&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;H&lt;/td&gt;

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">Happy to be able to add another cemetery cache to Joranda's "Illinois Spirit Quest".</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This is just a simple cemetery cache. I have been riding by this place since the early 60's. Some friends of our moved from Decatur to a farm west of here about 10 miles. When we'd come to visit, originally we'd take hwy 125 on down to Farmingdale Road and turn south. But we found this little road and started taking it instead. (I think we would save almost 30 seconds, haha)

Just west of this cemetery was an big old house back in the trees. The only thing I see now is the fence along the road and the one car garage that is about to fall down. After finding the cache, head on west and take a look. Just don't walk onto the grounds as I believe it's posted "private property".

When scoping out the area for a place to hide a container, one place looked like an ideal location. But when I brought the container out today, it wouldn't fit. So had to quickly find another location. This one shouldn't be too hard to find. It is a cammo'd sandwich-sized lock and lock with a few trade items inside. The log book and pen are in a baggie. Please be careful with the baggie and let me know if container gets wet.

Thanks for searching and always remember with cemetery caches...Please do not hunt for this cache from dusk to dawn. Please respect the people that have been laid here before us.

FTF Honors go to MillerClanIII  Congrats!</groundspeak:long_description>
      <groundspeak:encoded_hints>You really shouldn't need one. There are only so many places at GZ to hide a container this size</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Every cacher from the stroll in the park once a month cacher to the extreme night time racer for the FTF cacher has found themselves at one of these types of hides.  It's just too easy to place one in a pine tree and watch the DNFs pile up.  Well, this one is no different.  (except I don't have to look for it)  I'm going to be nice with this cache....No tricks.  It is a homemade micro placed in a pine tree.  If you do come up with this find, it may be a good idea just to remove the log and keep the cache in place. If you do remove the cache, it needs to go back were you found it. Parking on the street is allowed and you will only have 40 ft walk.  No Tricks!  Just a little cache in the tree....By far the easiest one in this series.   Good Luck&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">This virtual cache is located in Oak Ridge Cemetery. Here you will get to see the Illinois Vietnam Veterans Memorial, the Illinois Korean War Memorial and Lincolns Tomb. You will also learn a little bit about the Battle of the Chosin Reservoir.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">The coordinates above are the starting point. 
This second set are for the parking area at Lincolns tomb: N39 49.384 W089 39.392. 
This third set are for the receiving vault: N39 49.438 W089 39.343.

There are four questions that you will have to answer that insures that you visited each of these areas. You can go ahead and log the cache but if I don't receive an e-mail with the four correct answers your log will be deleted.
 
1. Robert C. _____ won the congressional medal of honor, What was his last name?

2. There is a stone marked The Chosin Reservoir how many Navy Crosses and Medals of Honor were given during this war?

3. In the sarcophagus room how many flags surround Lincolns tomb?

4. How many times did the receiving vault get used from 1866-1873?
____________________________________________________________

Oak Ridge Cemetery was dedicated on May 24, 1860, five years before Lincoln's death, just outside the town where Lincoln lived most of his adult life. It is likely that he attended the ceremonies and heard his friend James Conkling deliver the main address.

When Lincoln died in 1865, his Illinois friends immediately sought permission to bury his remains in Springfield. The committee that arranged his Springfield funeral also formed an association to build this tomb, which was dedicated in 1874. In 1895 the association deeded the tomb and surrounding grounds to the State of Illinois.

Lincoln's body first arrived in the cemetery's public receiving vault on the hill below the present tomb. The coffin of his son William, who died in the White House, also rested there. Both had traveled nearly 1,700 miles in a special railroad car by a circuitous route from Washington, D.C.

The 117-foot tall granite tomb contains the bodies of Lincoln, his wife Mary, and three of his four sons -- Edward, William and Thomas (Tad). Robert, the oldest son, planned to be buried in this tomb with his parents and brothers. When his own son, Abraham Lincoln II ("Jack") died in 1890, he brought the body to the Lincoln tomb. However, his wife, Mary Harlan Lincoln, chose a gravesite in Arlington National Cemetery instead, where Robert was buried in 1928 and Jack was moved in 1930.

Like other Lincoln sites, the tomb attracts visitors from all over the world, some of whom bring floral tributes. As you drive up, you will see towering oak trees against a gently rolling landscape. 


 Designed by Vermont sculptor Larkin Mead, the tomb features famous Lincoln statuary. It's worth a visit just to see the sculpture, both inside and out. Visitors often stop to rub the nose of this evocative bronze bust at the entrance. It's the work of Gutzon Borglum, who is most famous for his rendition of Lincoln at Mount Rushmore. You can see the original marble bust in the the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C. 
As you enter the building, you will see bronze statues and excerpts from some Lincoln speeches. A circular hallway leads to the marble burial chamber where Secretary Stanton's famous words command your attention: "Now he belongs to the ages." The terrible human cost of the Civil War has an immediacy here, as if Lincoln died yesterday.

A red marble marker stands above the area where Lincoln's coffin lies. His body actually rests below the floor in a steel and concrete-reinforced vault. This change was made in 1899 when the monument needed reconstruction, partly to deter grave robbers, because an attempt on the body had been made in 1876.

Visiting Information

The Lincoln Tomb State Historic Site is open daily from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. from March through October and until 4 p.m. from November through February. It is closed on major holidays. If you visit at 7 p.m. on Tuesday evenings from June through August, you can see a flag-lowering ceremony enacted by volunteers in Civil War uniforms.

We were on a limited schedule, so we didn't get to visit long any any of the waypoints. I would have liked to have spent longer at Lincoln's Tomb, but, as it was, we were nearly an hour late getting home [:(], in spite of our best efforts and minimal time on-site. We'll likely be back for another Springfield visit, very soon. Thanks, Rod &amp; Shelby!

This historic place offers many different monuments for you to visit while here but is only open certain hours of the day so make sure to check the sign when entering. The cemetery is not open after dark so there is no night caching. Please be respectful of all those resting here and place the cache back as you found it. The cache is big enough for some small swag and contains a log sheet but you will need to bring a writing utensil to sign as found. This cache was placed with permission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache owner:&lt;br /&gt;
- Maintains thier own caches. Please advise if there is a problem.&lt;br /&gt;

Spotted this location while out doing some maintenance on other caches in the area. this is placed in a cemetary which is very popular with tourist so please be respectful of the area. The cache can only be attempted during daylight hours because the cemetary opens around 8am and closes at dusk. Please be sure to read the sign when entering. The cache container is very similar to some others I have hidden. Should be an easy find if you look in the right spot. This cache owner: - Maintains thier own caches.

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">If you're one of those people who enjoy the history of Route 66, you should enjoy this cache. It's located just off the original pavement of the old highway right near where it used to cross Lake Springfield.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">The highway was given the name "mother road" by John Steinbeck in his book "The Grapes of Wrath." It's a highway celebrated in song, books and movies. Heck, it even had its own television show. (Does anyone remember the actors George Maharis and Martin Milner?)

You'll be driving on a portion of the old highway, and looking for a small (a little smaller than quart-sized) plastic drink container that is wrapped in camouflage tape. It's big enough for small travel bugs, and close to an Interstate 55 ramp, so it could be used as a bug hotel. Just keep in mind the container has a fairly small neck, so larger bugs won't fit inside. I started the cache with a log and a small travel bug and nothing else.

There is a business nearby and you pretty much have to drive through their area, and also some construction taking place fairly close to the cache. The area can be busy with muggles during the summer months, but should be pretty much isolated during colder months. But your final destination -- the cache -- is located where muggles shouldn't be a problem any time of the year.

There is little to no walking. You can basically drive right up to the cache (I'm lazy. I don't like to walk too far to place caches, so you don't have to walk far to retrieve them).

You don't really need a hint for the cache, but you can get a clue if you really need one. I'm not making it easy though. The hint is the same clue given by a couple of other geocaches. So if you need a hint, look one of these other caches up and read their hint. Have fun.</groundspeak:long_description>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">After lunch with the in-laws, I wanted to get a few choice caches in the Springfield area. I searched before coming up for caches with a placed date to help me with the Jasmer challenge. I already had this date completed, but I also love puzzle caches, so I solved this one last night. And what do you know, I was going after a cache very close to this final. I added this to my list and was able to make the find after a nice walk through the snow from a nearby location. It took a little searching to come up with the container since it was covered with snow. Then I was afraid I wouldn't be able to open the container because it was frozen. A small TOTT helped me pry up the latch and I was able to sign the log. A nice presidential puzzle and a great container. Thanks Scout65. I'm awarding this one a favorite point.

This was surprisingly easy after we had separately done our homework and answered the Presidential quiz. The tracks we left in the snow witness that we followed the GPSr arrow down the trail and to the cache site without wavering or backtracking. Nicely done and fun cache. TNLNSL.

Big Red and Dad spend a lot of hours at Lake Springfield, so it only seems fitting that Big Red would help us hide our first extreme cache(well extreme for Springfield!).  

You are looking for an ammo box stocked with the following:
an "I Found It!" Smiley button; a "Got Cache?" sticker; a Whoopie Cushion; Sudoku puzzle book; Velvet art poster; a Sherlock Holmes book on tape; Rain-X for your windshield; a Hippo Pez dispenser; lots of dollar bill pencils and USA pencils; a snowman cookie cutter and more!!  We aso put plenty of bandaids in the baggie with the log book and a pencil sharpener -- just in case you get all the way there and the pencil is broken (DO NOT take sharpener please).

The cemetery has operating hours so remember to check the sign when entering. The cemetery is not open after dark so there is no night caching. Also please be respectful of those resting here. The cache is between a nano size and micro size container which holds only a log sheet so please bring a writing utensil to sign as found. You may also need a special tool to retrieve the log sheet from the container. This one might be a little hard to spot for the beginner but a seasoned geocacher might be able to make quick work of this one. This cache was placed with permission.

These darn trees always seem to have a way of attacking us!  Of course it could  have been because we started digging around the sharp needles on the wrong side of the tree first!  Eventually found what we were looking for, signed log and replaced as found.  Cache is in good condition.  Thanks for the fun!

</groundspeak:short_description>

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;I promise you; whatever scum did this, not one man on this force will rest one minute until he's behind bars. Now, let's grab a bite to eat.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jane, since I've met you, I've noticed things that I never knew were there before... birds singing, dew glistening on a newly formed leaf, stoplights.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Cops and women don't mix. It's like eating a spoonful of Drano; sure, it'll clean you out, but it'll leave you hollow inside.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Doctors say that Nordberg has a 50/50 chance of living, though there's only a 10 percent chance of that.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;I think we can save your husband's arm. Where would you like it sent?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;It's the same old story. Boy finds girl, boy loses girl, girl finds boy, boy forgets girl, boy remembers girl, girl dies in a tragic blimp accident over the Orange Bowl on New Year's Day.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Women may or may not like these, but to be considered a real man, you need to have seen each of these movies (often several times).  To meet the requirements, the movie has to have stood the test of time (be at least 10 years old) and be a great movie for guys (sorry ladies, but we don’t always get into those “romantic comedies”). You can keep Hugh Grant, give me Mel Brooks or John Belushi any day!&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;These will not be at the exact location, but will be somewhere nearby.  To find it, you have to figure out the movie which will then give you the exact coordinates.  Once you find it, you will need to provide your own writing instrument and log it.  Finally, when you get home, you may have these lines stuck in your head and might feel an overwhelming urge to watch the move again (for the 142&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; time).  Feel free to give into these urges!&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Coordinates&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;N 39° 41.ABC W 089° 38.2EF&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;A = The total number of movies in the series&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;B = The number o fletters in the first name of the actresss who played Jane&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;C = The last number of the year the movie came out&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;D = The number of words in the title of the TV show the movie is based on&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;E = The number of letters in Frank's last name (the character, not the actor)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;F = The number of letters in the last name of the actor/possible murderer who played Nordberg&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">No, you won't need sleeping pills and it's not even a night cache. In fact, you can't look then because the park is closed at night. But you're not dreaming. There really is a cache hidden there. You'll be looking for a micro located in Dreamland Park on Springfield's southeast side.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">There apparently was some kind of an amusement park named "Dreamland" in Springfield in the 1920s and 1930s, and this park, one of Springfield's newer ones, was named in memory of that earlier day fun place. 

This cache is close to a parking lot with a paved pathway that leads nearly to the cache. It's not far. The terrain here does have some ups-and-downs, but it's still easy walking. There is a playground and a pretty little pond that looks as though it would provide some good fishing for the kids. You might have to use a little stealth while searching and grabbing this cache though. This park can be quite busy at times while almost devoid of humans at others. The ducks and geese, however, seem to be here all the time (maybe that will change when the pond freezes). 

The micro is a film canister with just a log and a nub of a pencil I managed to stuff inside. However, it might be a good idea to bring along your own pencil/pen in case the lead gets broken.</groundspeak:long_description>
      <groundspeak:encoded_hints>After your GPSr guides you there, it might be easier to let your fingers -- not your eyes -- do the walking to find this one.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Geocaching in Springfield and Decatur on the last day of June with Mean Gene and The Rooter. The mjipitch team that we just met at the [i]West Side 2[/i] cache noted that they hadn't found this one, so we were determined to look in the places that they might have missed. 

It turned out that the cache itself was missing, in a way. The magnet that used to be part of the cache container was still in place, but the container had come unglued from the magnet, and Mean Gene spotted it down on the ground once he saw the magnet. Not an easy find for Mean Gene, but, with a bit of duct tape to hold it together again, it should be an easy find for the next cachers, until the owner can get it properly repaired [;)]. TNLNSL.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">The Grand Army of the Republic (GAR) was a fraternal organization composed of veterans of the Union Army, US Navy, Marines and Revenue Cutter Service who served in the American Civil War. Founded in 1866 in Decatur, Illinois it was dissolved in 1956 when its last member died. Linking men through their experience of the war, the GAR became among the first organized advocacy groups in American politics, supporting voting rights for black veterans, lobbying the US Congress to establish veterans&amp;#39; pensions, and supporting Republican political candidates. Its peak membership, at more than 490,000, was in 1890, a high point of Civil War commemorative ceremonies. It was succeeded by the Sons of Union Veterans of Civil War (SUVCW), composed of male descendants of Union veterans

Since 1865, the cemetery has grown to be the largest Municipal cemetery in the state of Illinois, encompassing 365 acres of beautiful rolling prairie land, thousands of hardwoods and conifers, and over 75,000 interments. Oak Ridge Cemetery has the distinction of being the second most visited cemetery in the nation, second only to Arlington National Cemetery.  Almost one million visitors enter our gates annually not only to pay respects to their deceased families and ancestors, but to also visit the final resting place and pay homage to our distinguished sixteenth President, Abraham Lincoln. You can find this geocache near the original burial vault of the United States 16th President Abraham Lincoln but closer to the G.A.R Monument in Springfield&amp;#39;s historic cemetery. The cemetery has operating hours so make sure to check the sign when entering. The cemetery is not open after dark so there is no night caching. Also please be respectful of those resting here. The cache is a micro size container which holds a log sheet only so you will need to bring a writing utensil to sign as found. The cache is hidden above the monument so count your steps on the way up. This cache was placed with permission.

This cache owner:
- Maintains thier own caches. Please advise if there is a problem.
- Appreciates logs that are not cut and pasted :) Be creative
- As always PLEASE be careful out there

Good luck and Happy hunting.

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">This is a regular sized cache.  Before hitting the road for any journey you should always go over your plans, your route and safety issues.  What better way to do it than to send your Travel Bugs off to I Spy Academy.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">At I Spy Academy your Travel Bug can come and learn all there is to know prior to their journey.  They can have recess, spy on the businesses around or sit at the desk and become studious little TBs.  The academy is a privately owned school and the owners welcome your TBs to come and visit.  All tuition free!!!  They can stay as long as they want to or run off to new adventures as soon as the can catch a ride. 

This is on private property with the owner's permission.  You will not have to walk far onto the property to get this cache.  Feel free to wave hi if you should see someone out and about.  There is no need for stealth.  You are welcome to just come on up and grab the cache or just drop off a TB for school. 

The cache is clearly in plain sight, but it is hidden from muggles.  You may need to look a little, but it really truly is in plain sight.  

This has changed since the original listing.  The previous cache came up missing and we had to replace it.  It used to be called "I Spy".</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;While out checking on a few caches we have hidden in the area, we came upon this monument for the friendless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:1.6"&gt;The Springfield home for the friendless was established on President Abraham Lincoln&amp;#39;s birthday, February 12, 1863, at the height of the Civil War. Modeled on facilities in the east, the home was intended as a temporary refuge for Union War widows and orphans. In 1864 Springfield resident Elijah Iles donated property at the Northwest corner of 8th and South Grand, and with community support, construction of a permenant facility began. In January 1865 under the supervision of Rev. Francis Springer, Post Chaplain at Fort Smith, Arkansas, more than 300 refugees from war-torn Arkansas arrived in Springfield, many of them children. Suffering from exposure and illness, many died en route, those who survived lived at the home for the friendless; others were taken into the homes of local residents. Some fared well; others did not. The home for the fiendless continued to recieve refugees and orphans after the war. Later, abandoned infants and children who were victims of neglect and abuse and indigent mothers all found their way to the home for temporary or permenant relief. For some it offered a new life, for others it was the last stop. More than 200 children from the home for the friendless are buried at Oak Ridge Cemetery.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:1.6"&gt;This is a traditional size cache and was placed with permission. When searching for this cache, PLEASE be respectful of those resting here. This cache is only big enough for a log sheet so please bring a writing utensil to sign. The cache is only available to be found during hours of operation which are posted at the entrance of this cemetery. (8am to 5pm).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This cache owner:&lt;br /&gt;
- Maintains thier own caches. Please advise if there is a problem.&lt;br /&gt;
- Appreciates logs that are not cut and pasted :) Be creative&lt;br /&gt;
- As always PLEASE be careful out there&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Good luck and Happy hunting.&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">ULTIMATE GUY COMEDY MOVIES
&lt;p&gt;I’ve decided to create a series of caches based on lines from the ULTIMATE GUY COMEDY MOVIES!  Women may or may not like these, but to be considered a real man, you need to have seen each of these movies (often several times).  To meet the requirements, the movie has to have stood the test of time (be at least 10 years old) and be a great movie for guys (sorry ladies, but we don’t always get into those “romantic comedies”). You can keep Hugh Grant, give me Mel Brooks or John Belushi any day!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These will not be at the exact location, but will be somewhere nearby.  To find it, you have to figure out the movie which will then give you the exact coordinates.  Once you find it, you will need to provide your own writing instrument and log it.  Finally, when you get home, you may have these lines stuck in your head and might feel an overwhelming urge to watch the move again (for the 142&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; time).  Feel free to give into these urges!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:1.6em;"&gt;Coordinates:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N 39  41.1AB             &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;W 89  38.0C2            &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A = the last number of the year the movie was released&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B = the second number of the year the movie was released&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C = the third number of the year the movie was released&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;So I was sitting in my cubicle today, and I realized, ever since I started working, every single day of my life has been worse than the day before it. So that means that every single day that you see me, that's on the worst day of my life.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;And, and I told Don too, because they've moved my desk four times already this year, and I used to be over by the window, and I could see the squirrels, and they were married, but then, they switched from the Swingline to the Boston stapler, but I kept my Swingline stapler because it didn't bind up as much, and I kept the staples for the Swingline stapler and it's not okay because if they take my stapler then I'll set the building on fire...&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The thing is, Bob, it's not that I'm lazy, it's that I just don't care.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Looks like you've been missing a lot of work lately.-  I wouldn't say I've been *missing* it, Bob.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;You know what, Stan, if you want me to wear 37 pieces of flair, like your pretty boy over there, Brian, why don't you just make the minimum 37 pieces of flair?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The ratio of people to cake is too big.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ummm, I'm gonna need you to go ahead come in tomorrow. So if you could be here around 9 that would be great, mmmk... oh oh! and I almost forgot ahh, I'm also gonna need you to go ahead and come in on Sunday too, kay.&lt;/h3&gt;

We searched at the computed location and had no luck so we called a previous finder who told us to look about 30' further south. No luck there either, but we searched all of the other similar places within 100' without success, so we left a replacement in the original "30' further south" location.

The cache is a micro sized container holding a log sheet only so please bring a writing utensil to sign. As always please replace as found. The cache was placed with permission and can only be found during hours of operation which are posted at the entrances. (8am to 5pm).

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This is an easy park and grab cache good for a quick smiley. May be muggles around at certain times so a little stealth wouldn't hurt. This cache is big enough to hold the log only and has no pencil so please bring your own. 

This cache owner:
- Maintains thier own caches. Please advise if there is a problem.
- Appreciates logs that are not cut and pasted :) Be creative
- As always PLEASE be careful out there

Good luck and Happy hunting.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Geocaching in the Springfield area, logging caches concisely as "MG/TR/RO", on a near-perfect day late summer day with cool morning temperatures, high clouds and plenty of sun. We were very wary about this one. This was a busy place, and most folks don't appreciate strangers lurking around while their doing their business here. We waited in line for one customer to finish up, then made our "transaction" while a muggle customer behind us watched or stared.

I emailed another cache and got a clue. Came back first thing today before my meeting and looked for about 30 minutes in the rain. Was about to give up and then  checked on more spot and found it.

Mean Gene and I had been here on 1/31, with snow on the ground and all around, and failed to find the cache. Today was much easier, even though the coordinates still led us 18 feet too far directly to the east. Mean Gene found it in under 30 seconds, flat. TNLNSL.

I found a dandy cache hiding place in the wooden fence by the rest rooms, but didn't find the cache there. We paid special attention to the light tower, but just couldn't find anything there, even after a lengthy search [:(]. We'll be back! Thanks, tighedog! roelsch -- St. Charles, MO.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;ULTIMATE GUY COMEDY MOVIES&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve decided to create a series of caches based on lines from the ULTIMATE GUY COMEDY MOVIES! Women may or may not like these, but to be considered a real man, you need to have seen each of these movies (often several times). To meet the requirements, the movie has to have stood the test of time (be at least 10 years old) and be a great movie for guys (sorry ladies, but we don’t always get into those “romantic comedies”). You can keep Hugh Grant, give me Mel Brooks or John Belushi any day!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These will not be at the exact location, but will be somewhere nearby. To find it, you have to figure out the movie which will then give you the exact coordinates. Once you find it, you will need to provide your own writing instrument and log it. Finally, when you get home, you may have these lines stuck in your head and might feel an overwhelming urge to watch the move again (for the 142&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; time). Feel free to give into these urges!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coordinates:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;N 39 46.AB5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;W 89 36.6C&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A = the last number of the year the movie was released&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B = the last number of the year the movie was released minus the first number of the year the movie was released&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C = how old John Candy was when he died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;i&gt;Why here? When Barf got caught without a license this is where he ended up &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

Since March I have probably stopped by here at least a half dozen times.  Every time since that first time there have been lots of people around.  Today was no exception, There were at least a half dozen people working with there dogs nearby.  The exception today those was that there was a delivery truck between the cache and the muggles.  I had this one in hand in under thirty seconds today.  Cache container was super dirty which has now been transferred to the log , my hands, my pants...

While making your way to this cache you will possibly pass by the grave markers of the unknowns and when you get close to the cache you will discover why we named this cache the Flying Nuns. This is a traditional size cache holding a log sheet only so you will need to bring your own writing instrument to sign. While searching for this cache please be respectful of the folks resting here and the surrondings. This cache is only available during daylight hours so make sure to read the sign at the entrance pertaining to the open hours. The cache was placed with permission of one of the groundskeepers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This cache owner:&lt;br /&gt;
- Maintains thier own caches. Please advise if there is a problem.&lt;br /&gt;
- Appreciates logs that are not cut and pasted :) Be creative&lt;br /&gt;
- As always PLEASE be careful out there&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Good luck and Happy hunting.&lt;/p&gt;

Calvary Cemetery is located on the north side of Springfield and adjoins Oak Ridge Cemetery although neither is accessible from the other. Both are two of the largest cemeteries in Sangamon County. Calvary is owned and maintained by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Springfield.&amp;nbsp;Originally the cemetery started out as a burial place for German and Irish Catholics but today is non-denominational&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;We placed this cache here in honor&amp;nbsp;of a few people we know that are at their final resting place nearby. The cache is a micro sized container holding a log sheet only so please bring a writing utensil to sign. If you have found some of our containers which are similar you will know that all you have to do is unscrew the container without removing it completely from its hiding spot. As always please replace as found. The cache was placed with permission and can only be found during hours of operation which are posted at the entrances. (8am to 5pm). PLEASE be respectful of the folks resting nearby and the grounds on which this cache is hidden.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This cache owner:&lt;br /&gt;
- Maintains thier own caches. Please advise if there is a problem.&lt;br /&gt;
- Appreciates logs that are not cut and pasted :) Be creative&lt;br /&gt;
- As always PLEASE be careful out there&lt;br /&gt;

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">First in a series called "The Trees of Adams Wildlife Sanctuary."  The cache is located alongside the trail.  Easy walk and quick grab.  Enjoy the rest of the trail while you're here.   This Sanctuary is owned and managed by the Illinois Audubon Society.  Trails are open dawn to dusk.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">The cache is hidden in the remains of a fallen Shingle Oak (Quercus imbricaria)  Imbricaria is Latin for " overlapping," like roof shingles.

It is said that early French Creole colonists in Illinois used this species of oak to provide wooden shingles for their homes (it can easily be split into thin sheets.)

Leaf: Alternate, simple, 3 to 7 inches long. Shiny dark green above and paler and fuzzy below.  Shingle Oak is the only common Oak of the midwestern United States to have a leaf with smooth, unlobed margins.

Fruit: Acorns are 5/8 inch long, 1/3 to 1/2 covered by a thin, bowl-shaped cap with flat, light brown scales.

Bark: Gray-brown, tight and quite hard, with broad, irregular ridges and very shallow furrows.

There are several more shingle oaks growing throughout Adams Wildlife Sanctuary.</groundspeak:long_description>

We parked at the Audubon Society parking lot and took to the trail. There has been [i]extensive[/i] thinning of the underbrush and grounds with the result that there is presently an almost completely unobstructed view from the Audubon building to Prairie Telecom parking lot to the east.

Mean Gene found the cache in a completely denuded fallen tree that has long since given up its last shingle (and leaf and acorn, for that matter).

&lt;p&gt;- note, this has the same number as a former cahce that was destroyed by road work.  It is a new cache in a new location and a new movie-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve decided to create a series of caches based on lines from the ULTIMATE GUY COMEDY MOVIES!  Women may or may not like these, but to be considered a real man, you need to have seen each of these movies (often several times).  To meet the requirements, the movie has to have stood the test of time (be at least 10 years old) and be a great movie for guys (sorry ladies, but we don’t always get into those “romantic comedies”).  You can keep Hugh Grant, give me Mel Brooks or John Belushi any day!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These will not be at the exact location, but will be somewhere nearby.  To find it, you have to figure out the movie which will then give you the exact coordinates.  Once you find it, you will need to provide your own writing instrument and log it.  Finally, when you get home, you may have these lines stuck in your head and might feel an overwhelming urge to watch the move again (for the 142&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; time).  Feel free to give into these urges!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coordinates:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;N 39  45.ABC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;W 89  36.DEF&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A = Number of letters in the star's first name&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B = Last number of the year the movie was released&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C = Second number in the year the movie was released&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D = How many movies were made in this franchise (including this one)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E = Number of letters in the star's last name&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;F = Add the first and third numbers of the year the movie was released&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why here? This is the road they would have driven on from Chicago to St. Louis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">It all started September 19th, 2007 when schnauzermomx2 and searching_simpsons took a co-worker to find a geocache on a lunchbreak.  Less than 2 years, and 12 states, later, MacGregor07 is sitting on cache #999!  This cache becomes, and celebrates, the 1000th cache!

You are looking for a well camoflaged micro container hid well in nature.  Once off the bike trail, it is an easy walk to the cache.  Good luck and congratulate MacGregor when you pass on the trail!  

Bring you own pencil.  The walk is about 3/10ths of a mile from the trailhead parking at the IDOT parking lot--almost all on the paved bike trail.  Please be careful when opening the container -- the camoflage may be delicate!</groundspeak:long_description>

The clue never made any sense to me, but Mean Gene stumbled over the cache anyway – literally. The log was soaked beyond use, so we replaced it and the container, leaving the old one cache and log there, too. TNLNSL.

An awesome cacher replaced one of mine that was missing.  So when I went back to fix the problem, I found his replacement.  Now I have a problem--- what to do with this one.  So I thought --- how about placing an easy one and giving you all a break.  Well it's just not in my nature to hide a simple P&amp;amp;G. There has to be a challenge in there somewhere.  This one is easy to spot, not so easy to get to, but hard extremely hard to get and put back without being noticed.  My goal for this one is not to see a blue sad face log.  Enjoy the gift.  There wont be many of these from me.  &lt;/div&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>
      <groundspeak:encoded_hints>I think your challenge doesn't require a hint.  But to make this as easy for you as possible.  Its a film canister about 9 feet from the ground in the only place where it can be 9 feet from the ground.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

We cruised down many back roads and some highways picking up caches that fell into our path. We completed 4 geoart series, crossed through or into 5 states, many counties, competed at MOGA, ate way too much gas station food, both cheered and cursed each other. We found just over 800 caches in 6 days, picked up a decent amount of Munzees, got some medals for our effort at MOGA and generally had a good time.

Okay, I've told you where to look, the size of the cache container and even what color it is. I think I'll leave the rest to you. I really don't think it will take you that long to find it.

The coordinates were excellent on this one, thankfully, but the tiny size of the cache container compared to the large area to be searched meant that it took us a few minutes to locate this one. We had a $1 store mirror with us, but in the end, the Braille method was what found the cache. TNLNSL. Thanks, NebulousNimrod! -- roelsch, St. Charles, MO

You will be hiking on a non-paved access trail leading to the Lost Bridge bike trail.  Best parking is probably at the IDOT trail head parking lot.  There are many caches close by on this bike trail - so keep going up the trail for more smilies!

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This cache is located on private property with permission from the business.  You are looking for an ammo box in the bushes.  There is a lock on the Ammo Box to deter any possible muggles. There are instructions with the box that only a geocacher would take the time to read to help you unlock the box.  I picked this location because of the very cool Rt. 66 museum across the street...so while you are unlocking the box... I am sure you will have time to see all the signs, gas pumps and other cool items from Rt. 66 that are displayed outdoors on their property.  Enjoy your find and I hope it makes it to your Favorite list.&lt;/p&gt;
As a final note...I did rate this as a ADA wheelchair accessible cache. There is easy parking...and the bushes are on a raised platform and would be chest level for a cacher in a wheelchair.

This one was a bit of a challenge for us.  Couldn't find one of the signs for the first clue, then couldn't read all the letters for the second clue (we're both nearsighted) and then used the owner's name without the "s".  FINALLY was able to solve through process of elimination, but no goodies in the cache, only the log.  Glad we were able to solve this one!  TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

For over one hundred years the main means of communication was by
telegraph. There is still remains of the wires, insulators, and
poles along these old railways. You will see several of these poles
and maybee a few of the insulators. Most have been taken along with
the wire to sell for scrap. When you look at the remains imagine
all the messages sent across these poles over the years.&lt;br&gt;

There is a parking lot and you'll be within 150 to 200 feet of easy walking to get to the cache. No bushwacking required. You're looking for a disguised waterproof match holder. There is no room for trade items. I put a pencil in there, but it wouldn't hurt to bring along your own writing instrument in case the lead gets broken.</groundspeak:long_description>

If anything was wrong with any cache steph logged it so there isn't any need in me repeating it lol...I'm a lazy logger, it takes me sometimes a few months to log, she's a quick OCD type logger, she logs the same day or first thing the very next day lol...So she always beats me to the punch :)  TFTC!!!!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;ULTIMATE GUY COMEDY MOVIES&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;--Note: to fans of the series, I have loads more, but will be slower getting them out as school starts tomorrow and I will be busy grading, working lesson plans, etc... Had to get this one out, though, as it is one of the top &lt;i&gt;guy movies&lt;/i&gt; of all time, period. Once again, too many great quotes to fit into the 500 character intro. See ya on the hunt!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve decided to create a series of caches based on lines from the ULTIMATE GUY COMEDY MOVIES! Women may or may not like these, but to be considered a real man, you need to have seen each of these movies (often several times). To meet the requirements, the movie has to have stood the test of time (be at least 10 years old) and be a great movie for guys (sorry ladies, but we don’t always get into those “romantic comedies”). You can keep Hugh Grant, give me Mel Brooks or John Belushi any day!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These will not be at the exact location, but will be somewhere nearby. To find it, you have to figure out the movie which will then give you the exact coordinates. Once you find it, you will need to provide your own writing instrument and log it. Finally, when you get home, you may have these lines stuck in your head and might feel an overwhelming urge to watch the move again (for the 142&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; time). Feel free to give into these urges!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coordinates:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;N 39 43.3AB&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;W 89 36.CDE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A = the third number of the year the movie was released minus 5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B = the third numbers of the year the movie was released&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C = the last number of the year the "Germans" bombed Pearl Harbor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D = how many Academy Awards the movie won&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E = The last number of the year the movie was released minus the first number&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why here? Welcome to college.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

There was a two-man crew from CWLP working with a hydraulic chain saw on a boom truck (we could have used THAT later in the day) when we arrived. The search area was close enough to where they were cutting that as the ground-man chatted with us the aerial-guy took a short break to avoid debris accidents. The ground-man explained that they had previously done serious cutting on the cache side of the road and dragged the debris to a truck for disposal. Neither worker had come across the cache container.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Ori's revenge #2 ----- ROCKS!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;   Anyone who has been caching with me knows what kind of cranky baby I am flipping rocks.  Even though this is #2 on the list.... Rock hides by far are my least favorte type of hides in all of the geocaching world.  Well, for most of you, this will be a real challenge.  On the brighter side.  You have a great view of Lake Springfield.  The cache is less than 20 feet from the parking lot.  Bluegill fishing is really good here....Lets see, did I mention the parking.  If you are lucking enough to find this cache...It is extremely important to put back where you found it.  When I check this, I DO NOT want to look for it.  Remember...I hate rock hides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ori's Revenge series was placed in the Springfield area to highlight my LEAST favorite type of locations to hunt for a cache.  Why do you ask would I put out such a nasty series.  Well first of all, Springfield has already got plenty of P&amp;amp;Gs and family friendly caches to choose from.  But I will have to say revenge is the main reason these are placed.  I have spent too many hours at locations like these.  Now it's my turn.  I will NOT be giving out ANY hints for these until it is found.  Even after the cache has been found, to get a hint, you must first log a DNF. Those are the rules.  Please respect all rules and laws of parks and parking when hunting. This series isn't for everyone... I personally would bring a pen and tweezers on these caches.  If you can't find it, that doesn't mean a "requires maintence" or "needs archived" should to be logged.  This series of caches is for the Geocacher who loves a challenge and the feeling of victory from a tough find....So if your ideal caching is a day filled with lamppost skirt lifting and going from telephone pole to telephone pole...You may not want to do these.  BUT MOST OF YOU WILL!  ENJOY or just ignore...LOL&lt;/p&gt;

In November I was closer to the top of the hill next to the fence.  Today I was just above the waterline about three feet.  The GPS was also bouncing around madly before it settled down here.  It jumped from 15 feet to 65 before I was even on the rocks.  I'm starting to think that Mrori has a device hidden nearby that is screwing with the GPS :).  I'll try again the next time I'm in town.</groundspeak:text>

This cache is a 5….(and I have found much easier caches that were D5s)  Fuzzy has a cache in Peoria that has 355 DNFs.  By no means am I trying to compare this one to the legend at the shelter, but it is hard…Very hard.  You will not just flip a rock and "Bam!" there it is.  I will say this again.  It is most certainly a legal cache, the cords are good, (this means if found, no one will log "cords are off!") I haven't decided, but I think I might post a pic of the cache container and what it looks like in a similar location.  But I might not.  This is a revenge series of my most hated places to look for caches.  And this one will be the hardest.  So Please, don't get upset, just hit ignore.</groundspeak:text>

&lt;p&gt;This is a Nano I hid that should be a quick stop and grab. The
Cache should be very easy to find once you get there as there are
not too many places to look. Bring a pencil or pen and please bring
twezers as this is a tight nano. ok so here is the catch. The
coordinates listed do not take you to the cache. Instead they would
take you to fairview school. To get the coordinates you must figure
out the following puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am some what of a computer nerd and so I thought I would make
some Binary tables for you to decode. So here is the puzzle, below
is a table that represents a basic princible for a dip switch
control you would find on most electronics. The On and off
positions tell the computer if this is a 1 or a 0. For each ON
write a 1 and for each OFF write a 0. This will give you the Binary
coordinates. Then you can start to decode the binary to decimal.
This should be the fun part.&lt;/p&gt;

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Geocaching with Mean Gene and The Rooter in Springfield and East Peoria on the first complete day of Summer, 2008. I guess maybe not many folks know how to do non-decimal fractional arithmetic. I thought that Team Geoski might have been one of the rare exceptions, but Mean Gene didn't think so. Mean Gene was right. I guess I'll have to put out my own non-decimal fractional cache and see who can find it! 

We found that the coordinates for this one took us over by a nice new wooden fence and a chain link fence, but we didn't find anything there. We re-read the cache name, turned around, and spotted the cache about 50' away. TNLNSL. Thanks, Team Geoski, for placing this cache! -- roelsch, St. Charles, Mo.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Ori's Revenge #1 ------ Bleachers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left:40px;"&gt;           Pulling up to a nice park with fresh cut grass gives me a warm, fuzzy feeling when I am out geocaching.  But the feelings soon changes to dread when my GPS is making a bee line to some bleachers.  I hate bleacher hides.  I know one of two things are going to happen now.  1. I will be able to spot a magnetic key box from the underbelly of the bleachers... or 2.  I will have to run my hands down every inch of this thing to make the grab...and sometimes that doesn't even work.  Well my friends, Bleachers is not a typical hide....Many curveballs have been seen from these bleachers, but now your up to bat.  This geocache follows all the rules and can be found at a reasonable distance from GZ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ori's Revenge series was placed in the Springfield area to highlight my LEAST favorite type of locations to hunt for a cache.  Why do you ask would I put out such a nasty series.  Well first of all, Springfield has already got plenty of P&amp;amp;Gs and family friendly caches to choose from.  But I will have to say revenge is the main reason these are placed.  I have spent too many hours at locations like these.  Now it's my turn.  I will NOT be giving out ANY hints for these until it is found.  Even after the cache has been found, to get a hint, you must first log a DNF. Those are the rules.  Please respect all rules and laws of parks and parking when hunting. This series isn't for everyone... I personally would bring a pen and tweezers for these caches.  If you can't find it, that doesn't mean a "requires maintence" or "needs archived" should to be logged.  This series of caches is for the Geocacher who loves a challenge and the feeling of victory from a tough find....So if your ideal caching is a day filled with lamppost skirt lifting and going from telephone pole to telephone pole...You may not want to do these.  BUT MOST OF YOU WILL!  ENJOY or just ignore...LOL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

If anything was wrong with any cache steph logged it so there isn't any need in me repeating it lol...I'm a lazy logger, it takes me sometimes a few months to log, she's a quick OCD type logger, she logs the same day or first thing the very next day lol...So she always beats me to the punch :)  TFTC!!!!

Side note:  I was getting very close to 3000 caches, I had counted and made sure we went to this one to make it my 3000th find, I had planned a huge trip to Peoria to get my 3000th, but some personal issues made that not happen, so I figured what better cache to make my 3000th then a hard cache placed by a good friend, but then I plugged my GPS in to start logging caches and low and behold I had about 20 on there that I had forgotten to log from a while back, so this one wasn't my 3000th :( cache, my 3000th turned out to be some park and grab from cachers I don't know :( oh well i'll aim to make my 4000th a good one from you I hope :)</groundspeak:text>

(i got very lucky as i only checked a couple of places before finding it). now i have few xtra min to look for some more. lol.  the cache is in great shape, and is 1 of many on the day for us. thanks ori for the hide, (bleachers don't seem to bother me especially if you can just flip them over like we have a few time. lol), putting out a series i hope grows into a big one, and of course the quick smiley for me. you get a fav from me.</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I went on a geocaching trip this weekend with some fellow geocachers and friends also known as the CK Team. We signed our logs "C3PN" for (Capn Sea Bert, Cycle Ken, Crazy4Moose, Phil 4:13, &amp; Nickel01) using the first letter in each of our caching names. We decided to head for the Springfield, IL area because there are ton of geocaches and we wanted to see how many we could get. There are already many stories and adventures to share.

Thank you to Lincoln Memorial Gardens for permission to set this cache in the Ostermeier Prairie Center.
***Please stay on the path and respect this area so that we may keep our cache!*** (Plus it's the right thing to do!)</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This cache is set in the Ostermeier Prairie Center owned by Lincoln Memorial Gardens.  If you are up for an easy find and want an excuse to enjoy a beautiful walk in the prairie, this cache is for you!

Option #1 (shorter and easier):  Park in the Ostermeier Prairie Center official parking area.  The entrance is approximately 3/4 mile SW of Lincoln Memorial Gardens on East Lake Drive.  There is an sign with "Ostermeier Prairie Center" on it-driveway is before the sign at the fire hydrant if coming from Lincoln Memorial Gardens.  Turn right and drive past the farmhouse to parking. There are two trailheads visible from the parking lot. The first and more obvious heads SW into the prairie, while the other heads north around the barn and greenhouse, past the picnic benches and restrooms.

Option #2 (longer and more challenging to navigate!):  Park at Lincoln Memorial Gardens and start at the Nature Center.  Your walk will be about a 1/2 mile and you may have satellite interference from the trees!

For a map of the trails, see the Lincoln Memorial Gardens web page:

http://www.lmgnc.com/index_page0007.htm

***The Ostermeier Prairie Center closes at Sunset!***

The cache is a Rubbermaid tub with an "Official Geocache" sticker on top.  We tried to place items representative of the Illinois State Museum's collections.  The following items were placed in this Geocache:
-wooly mammoth
-dragonfly keychain
-projectile point (replica)
-shark's tooth necklace (replica)
-3 Illinois State Museum postcards
-Illinois State Museum Patch
-Fluorite sample with "Nature Symbols of Illinois" pamphlet
-"Field Checklist of Illinois Birds" Pamphlet
-"Mineral &amp; Fossil Identification" sheet
-Paper made from Illinois Tall Grass Prairie Plants (made by Illinois Artisans)
-"Dig into Fossils" kids book
-Illinois State Museum and Lincoln Memorial Garden Informational Pamphlets

We will be updating this cache with Travel Bugs in the near future!

We were a mite perplexed on this one for a time -- even had the Security guy come by in his cart and offer some help (after he had determined what we were attempting). 

We put the answer together bit by bit by following the directions -- and then the answer we had matched something we saw, or rather, something we saw matched the answer we were formulating. Somehow it all came together -- and the hunt was over. Nicely done -- just enough information to get the job done. TNLNSL. Thanks, Arsoneye! roelsch -- St. Charles, MO.

Railroad line. The trail is so named because the bridge over the

Springfield and Rochester.&lt;br&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;As for the cache....I was just planning a nice little P&amp;amp;G with a very traditional type of container....But when I got there, I just couldn't do it.  Very easy to find and safe parking is 50 to 100 feet away.  Finding the cache should not be a problem.  Reaching it without looking silly may be an issue.  I suggest for logging this cache you follow some simple instructions.  1. Locate the cache   2. Plan your attack   3. Wait till the coast relatively clear   4. Make the grab and sign   5.  Repeat steps 2 and 3   6.  Place back at the same place on the same side.  If you are feeling cocky, I have another one like this that is MUCH TOUGHER very close by.  Neither of these caches are kid friendly, so use your head.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Kali sounds like a dog's name or maybe the translation of someone's name in Hawaiian (I know which). A Kat's just that. Kool? Not really. In fact, it might be just the opposite. Kontroversial? Well, in addition to not knowing what size this cache is, I'm not sure if this cache is covered up or in plain sight. What do you think? Micro or small? And tell me whether you think it's covered up or in plain sight when you find the cache too.

I got the idea for this cache from one I found in southern Illinois. I'm giving it a 2 difficulty rating, even though I got lucky and found the one down there pretty easily.

I'm too old and too tired to go too far into the woods, so this cache -- as are most of my caches -- is located very close to parking and is an easy, level walk.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;ULTIMATE GUY COMEDY MOVIES&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve decided to create a series of caches based on lines from the ULTIMATE GUY COMEDY MOVIES! Women may or may not like these, but to be considered a real man, you need to have seen each of these movies (often several times). To meet the requirements, the movie has to have stood the test of time (be at least 10 years old) and be a great movie for guys (sorry ladies, but we don’t always get into those “romantic comedies”). You can keep Hugh Grant, give me Mel Brooks or John Belushi any day!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These will not be at the exact location, but will be somewhere nearby. To find it, you have to figure out the movie which will then give you the exact coordinates. Once you find it, you will need to provide your own writing instrument and log it. Finally, when you get home, you may have these lines stuck in your head and might feel an overwhelming urge to watch the move again (for the 142&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; time). Feel free to give into these urges!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coordinates:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;N 39 48.0A0&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;W 89 35.B2C&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A = double the last number of the year the movie was released&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B = the second number of the year the movie was released&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C = the third number of the year the movie was released&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">I've been meaning to put out this cache for the past couple of months, but just never have gotten around to it until now. Finding how to get to the Nickels cache might be the hardest part of logging this one. I'm betting this is a spot that few residents of Springfield or central Illinois have visited. I know I had never been there before. But they likely have seen this spot in person numerous times and have seen the view from this cache on the local television news on holiday weekends or when the roads are covered with snow and ice.

This cache is about a five minute drive off the interstate for those of you who are just passing through and looking for a break.

Get to Cooking. This one isn't that difficult to find. There is a place to pull over and park just a few yards east of the cache. There's no room for trade items except maybe a geocoin that's on the move. The cache contains only a log, so bring along your own pen or pencil.  

If you have acrophobia or vertigo, you might want to skip this one. One more thing needs to be said: Be careful to not drop it, because you can't retrieve it if you do.

This one is too easy for a hint, but write me if you need one.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;This cache is part of a series of other geocaches. The Jim Henson Company has hidden Dinosaur Train themed geocaches nationwide with the help of local PBS stations. To find the location of other Dinosaur Train themed geocaches, simply search for "Dinosaur Train" in the &lt;a href=
"http://www.geocaching.com/seek/default.aspx"&gt;keyword search option&lt;/a&gt;. Each geocache celebrates a dinosaur featured in the &lt;a href=
"http://pbskids.org/dinosaurtrain/games/fieldguide.html"&gt;Dinosaur Train Field Guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This geocache is the Lambeosaurus geocache. This duckbilled dinosaur had a hollow head crest made of bone.  The crest was probably used to make sounds so that it could communicate with other Lambeosaurus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is your favorite dinosaur? Be sure to tell us when signing the logbook!&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">You're looking for a small Tupperware-type container wrapped in camouflage tape and hidden near Springfield.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This is one of the four hides you'll need to find the mother cache, the "Four Deuces Cache." Add the three numbers you'll find in this container (I've put it there several places), to the number you'll find in the "Deuces are Wild - Clubs" cache to obtain the final three numbers for the North coordinate of the Four Deuces Cache.

This hide will take you to the southeast part of city. There is plenty of parking nearby and very limited bushwhacking (not more than 10 to 15 feet). There can be a lot of muggles present, especially on weekends, but they shouldn't affect your search, just their curiosity.

There are no treasures inside to trade, but the container is big enough to hold small items or small-sized travel bugs if you want to leave something. Please make sure you secure the lid when you re-hide the cache, so it doesn't fill with water from rains.

You can email me for help if you need it.

After several cachers told me the coordinates were off, I decided to check this out. I had three readings before listing the cache and they all seemed to be right on the mark. However, now it appears to be about 30 feet off from the listed coordinates... so, if you can't find it using the original, put these in and see if you don't get closer: N 39 44.376 and W089 34.916.</groundspeak:long_description>

Rain pretty much destroyed the last night of the carnival so we went home early.  I noticed these guys popped up during the Hawks game so I decided to get this one tonight on the way home.  No rain at the time of the search, but everything was wet and very dark.  Made the find rather quickly.  When I got back in the car Aidyn was listening to the radio and Emimen's Loose Yourself was on.  Not much into rap….But that's a jam most everyone likes.  Thanks Old Goat for this one and FTF#228.  I may get up early and score #229 tomorrow….We'll see.  tftc

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">I have been meaning to place a geocache in this little park for quite some time, and when I went to retrieve another cache that's already located there, it made me realize even more how great a place this park would be for a hide.

You will be looking for a camouflaged micro that is fairly close to the parking lot (so you won't have to walk very far). It's just a little smaller than a film canister.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This place has lots of areas for great hides, so picking one spot to place it was difficult. I'm giving it a 3 1/2 rating for difficulty just based on the number of places it could be. And I tried to make it a little hard. Some cachers will go right to it, while others will search awhile. But I think the experienced ones will find it if they spend some time there.

I started this one as a 2 1/2 difficulty, but it's a lot tougher than I thought, so I bumped it up to a 3 1/2. 

This is a daylight only cache, as the park is closed at night.

There's nothing but a log inside, and you'll have to bring your own writing device.</groundspeak:long_description>

We got a hint from the owner before we headed here, and it proved to be just the nudge we needed. We still had to look closely, but the cache wasn't as hard a find as it could have been. TNLNSL.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Science #1 is a cache that shouldn't give you much trouble to find, but may have you scratching your head... "How do I get it?"  The container is large and easy to find but the log is in the bottom in a much smaller cache.  Confused??? Well this is NOT how you get to the log.
1. Cutting down any part of the tree.
2. Tearing apart the cache away from it's spot.
3. Cutting any part of the cache.


If done right the Cache will come to you!  What you will need.  
1. Your own pen or pencil
2. A container that holds at least 1.17 L of a liquid. (Yup, you read that correctly--- I have one there now, but like I tell my students--- better to be over prepared.)
3. NO TRADE ITEMS please.

1. Scared of Water--- You won't have to get wet, but you might.
2. Scared of heights--- You will be around 7 ft. off the ground.
3. A child.  Not a kid friendly cache.  Thanks

Ok-- It's really not that bad.  When I put this out my 80 lb. Boxer followed me the whole way.  That was a funny sight! You will be looking for a cache made from something you use in the greatest sport in the world  "GO FLYERS!"  Please bring:
1. Your own Pen and Pencil
2. Tweezers--- Log is in there tight.
3. The Log is Small--- please replace if needed or e-mail me and I will take care of it.

Please have fun, be careful, and replace the way you found it.</groundspeak:long_description>

A great beginner Multi-Step Puzzle- (Stage 2 is less than .11 miles away)
You will need to find a camo water bottle and figure out the Tangrams puzzle to find the next set of cords.  A clue word will be hidden in the puzzle.  
Small trade items welcome in final cache.

I found stage one laying on the ground, which I rehid where I think it fell from.  I quickly did the puzzle and thankfully took a picture of it completed.  When I arrived at stage 2 there has been a lot of construction recently in the area and I was beginning to think that maybe the cache was gone.  Then I read the hint and turned to my phone for the real hint.  I then focused my attention on the new area and after a few layers I found the cache.  TFTC</groundspeak:text>

I feel so out of place.  But an easy P&amp;amp;G at the right time of day.  Stay to the left (3809) and if you see homeowner out in the yard please feel free to introduce yourself.  Small trade Items wanted.  (My son loves this part of Geocaching) A $2 bill to the FTF..... BONUS BONUS BONUS If you can find the "Oscar Cache" you can double DOG oh I mean double LOG this! The "Oscar Cache" is not a real geocaching cache and just for fun. THERE IS NO CORDS for this Bonus Cache. You may want to take a look at the pic on the listing for help.

I tried for this one back in December but discovered that the final was not loded on the GPS.  I made sure before the trip down that it was loaded and this morning I took the dog for a quick walk North through the fields.  I probably entered the area not more than 5 feet fromthe cache but backtracked West to the coordinates I had come up with.  After a few minutes I started working my way back East looking in all of the obvious hiding places.  I was about 50 feet East of my final coordinates when I found it.  Then it was back to the house where the dog got a good hosing after rolling in something.

If you do, cords are right on and not in the field.  Thanks Old Goat for yet another cache.  Sorry this one took so long.  With the FTF prize is gone, the long walk tends to look REALLY LONG.  tftc

This was our first cache of the day, a very late addition to the route. We didn't see a single goat (but I think we could smell them) so we had to find this one on our own.

We did our best imitations of Larry, Moe and Curly as we searched for this one. There's obviously been vandalism in the area and the recent DNFs indicated that this cache was gone, so we left a temporary replacement 35mm film canister at GZ. A passing motorist asked: "Are you going to fix it??" and we flashed back a thumbs-up... but she might have meant the damaged flood lights instead of the geocache?

I noticed the listing for the cache listed above.  I was intrigued to say the least.  I brought MapRat with me today so we could find the cache and maybe the entrance to Pet Haven Cemetery.  We accomplished both.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This is in honor of MacGregor07 for giving us quite the challenge. Not in locating the cache, but in locating the entrance.  I have posted pictures in the gallery for all to see.  I have not disclosed the site of Pet Haven Cache, but I am posting pictures of the area nearby as well as pictures of the entrance and some of the tombstones inside the cememtery.  Yes, this is a peaceful place.  Thanks for bringing us here.

Parking for the cemetary is at: N39 48.269 W189 35.276 and the easiest way to get into the cemetery.

Additional Waypoints
PK2CA93 - Entrance to Pet Haven Cemetery
N 39° 48.269 W 089° 35.276
You can park here and then enter into the cemetery and then walk to the cache.

Our last names are Taylor and the team we walked with was Bunn.  I decided to place a hide here to honor all the men who walked in their high heel shoes to raise money for PCASA.  I've walked in heels for a long time, but I am sure it was not easy for many of the men who did walk a real mile in high heel shoes.  So I tip my heels to all of you who walked.</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;ULTIMATE GUY COMEDY MOVIES&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continuing on with the ULTIMATE GUY COMEDY MOVIES! Women may or may not like these, but to be considered a real man, you need to have seen each of these movies (often several times). To meet the requirements, the movie has to have stood the test of time (be at least 1990's or earlier) and be a great movie for guys (sorry ladies, but we don’t always get into those “romantic comedies”). You can keep Hugh Grant, give me Mel Brooks or John Belushi any day!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These will not be at the exact location, but will be somewhere nearby. To find it, you have to figure out the movie which will then give you the exact coordinates. Once you find it, you will need to provide your own writing instrument and log it. Finally, when you get home, you may have these lines stuck in your head and might feel an overwhelming urge to watch the move again (for the 142&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; time). Feel free to give into these urges!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coordinates:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;N 39 48.ABC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;W 89 35.DEF&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A = how many points are given for the point after kick in football&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B = the number of nines in the year the movie was made&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C = the number of letters in the star's last name&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D = how many points you earn for a field goal&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E = the last number of the year the movie was released&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;F = the last number of the last year the star was a SNL regular cast member&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why here? Bobby Boucher's dream job.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

There will be lots of muggles here year round, so make sure no one is watching when you retrieve the cache. Stealth will be required. Lots of stealth.

Did I mention that you'll have to bring your own pencil/pen?

If you search the right day of the year, this one should be easy. It's actually kind of bizarro (if you read the comics), but there are some hints in the cache description. And if you need a little more help, open the clue. If you still can't find it, drop me a note and I'll send you some help.</groundspeak:long_description>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Geocaching with Mean Gene and The Rooter on a windy, rainy, sleety, snowy, cold, and overcast but also briefly sunny day – perfect geocaching weather! Mother Nature was playing with us on this one. We no sooner arrived, in the rain, than the wind began to blow in gusts of 35 to 40 mph. The Rooter retreated to the car to "supervise", but Mean Gene and I persisted.

About then the rain turned briefly to little crystals of sleet, but Mean Gene and I persisted. We patrolled a stretch ranging from 50 linear feet in one direction of GZ to 50 feet in the other – still nothing. 

We expanded the search further and... there it was! Good coordinates, if we'd only used them sooner. TNLNSL. Thanks, NebulousNimrod! -- roelsch, St. Charles, MO.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Continuing on with the ULTIMATE GUY COMEDY MOVIES! Women may or may not like these, but to be considered a real man, you need to have seen each of these movies (often several times). To meet the requirements, the movie has to have stood the test of time (be at least 1990's or earlier) and be a great movie for guys (sorry ladies, but we don’t always get into those “romantic comedies”). You can keep Hugh Grant, give me Mel Brooks or John Belushi any day!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These will not be at the exact location, but will be somewhere nearby. To find it, you have to figure out the movie which will then give you the exact coordinates. Once you find it, you will need to provide your own writing instrument and log it. Finally, when you get home, you may have these lines stuck in your head and might feel an overwhelming urge to watch the move again (for the 142&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; time). Feel free to give into these urges!&lt;/p&gt;

MapRat was a tanker in the US Army and he has a strong knowledge of tanks. This is just one of the roads we were on while out scoping the area for him. I just happened to see a spot I liked so I hid one here.   Once again I saw a bridge.  What more can I say!

Congrats to all of the FTF team.  It's great to know that after a full year of sitting on a bridge that someone thought outside the box and found it.</groundspeak:long_description>

This was the best hike of the day and a runner-up in the favorite of the day contest. We followed Blackberry trail until it started to head north then followed another trail south to the vicinity of the cache. Spotting the cache was very easy, even with its camouflage. The only downside of the hike was a back-muscle spasm that started on the return hike... and is still with me today, two days later [:(].

Please park in an appropriate location on a road in the cemetary. The above coordinates take you to a tombstone for clues to the final. There are several tombstones dating back to the 1700's. Relatively easy puzzle cache. Minimum walking distance between the two coordinates.. You will enjoy the view upward from the actual location of the final. 
You are looking for a 5 inch long by 3 1/2inch high black container. It will hold small items.

Use the information from the tombstone to solve for the final location.
39 45.30A
089 33.0BC

To solve for A - How many letters are above the Year inside the star at the base of the tombstone

To solve for B &amp; C (1st digit=B, 2nd digit=C)Take the Year John T. Benham died minus the Year of the War he served in and add 3.

Please don't disturb the base at the final looking for the cache. Best to read the hint. DON'T FORGET TO LOOK UP WHEN YOU LOCATE THE FINAL!

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">While driving back to Peoria after a date weekend in St. Louis, Mr. and Mrs. SRS2 stopped by Riverside Park to locate this cache.  The park was pretty quiet, so we parked at the closest-to-GZ point along the road to the north and made the short walk to GZ.  However, once there, it took us a while to locate the container since the coordinates seemed off by about 70 feet!  Given the fact the coordinates were off, I posted my set here.  After I found the cache and signed the logbook, Mrs. SRS2 was very thankful to be heading back to the warm car!

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;ULTIMATE GUY COMEDY MOVIES&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve decided to create a series of caches based on lines from the ULTIMATE GUY COMEDY MOVIES! Women may or may not like these, but to be considered a real man, you need to have seen each of these movies (often several times). To meet the requirements, the movie has to have stood the test of time (be at least 10 years old) and be a great movie for guys (sorry ladies, but we don’t always get into those “romantic comedies”). You can keep Hugh Grant, give me Mel Brooks or John Belushi any day!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These will not be at the exact location, but will be somewhere nearby. To find it, you have to figure out the movie which will then give you the exact coordinates. Once you find it, you will need to provide your own writing instrument and log it. Finally, when you get home, you may have these lines stuck in your head and might feel an overwhelming urge to watch the move again (for the 142&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; time). Feel free to give into these urges!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coordinates:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;N 39 45.1AB&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;W 89 33.2CD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A = the third number in the year of the car divided by two&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B = how many friends skipped school with the star&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C = the third number of the year the movie was released&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D = how many sisters the star has in the movie&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why this spot? - Because I couldn't place it at Wrigley Field (duh).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;- The ashtray, this paddle game, and the remote control, and the lamp, and that's all I need. &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry I've had to slow down on these but a) school started and being a teacher takes a lot of your free time and b) I ran out of containers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the greatest comdeies of all time - if you don't know it by the first hint, I suggest you rent the movie and watch it over and over again until you have it memorized.  Now don't get the TV version (too many bleeps and cuts), ya gotta see the real thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WARNING - This is a highly travelled muggle area!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E = The last number of the year Steve was born plus the third number of that year&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why here?  It is on the border of a city where a large number of people fitting the description of the movie title work (hint - look for the dome).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Geocaching with Mean Gene and The Rooter, signing logs as "MG/TR/RO", on a second trip to Springfield IL in the summer heat. This turned out to be our last cache of the day. We started out thinking that we'd park along the roadway for Business I-55, but parked inside the park instead. Then we thought we'd hike along the roadway, but a small but obvious trail called to us "Follow me!". The small trail became a larger trail and soon we were at GZ wondering where the cache could be. The only likely place was right there in front of us, but a close visual inspection (in the wrong place) netted nothing. Mean Gene shook things up to see what might rattle... and soon thereafter, we had the cache (and a couple of jingle bells [;)]) in hand. Thanks, Coalburner, for placing this cache! -- roelsch, St. Charles, MO.</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Geocaching with Mean Gene and The Rooter in Springfield on an unseasonably warm Memorial Day weekend. There were stretches along this trail where my GPS just refused to update for hundreds of feet at a time. When I would switch to satellite view, I only had one bar showing, from the satellite that was nearly overhead. The vegetation didn't seem like it was crowding in from all sides, but I guess if you add enough of it together along the line-of-sight, well, there goes the signal. 

Fortunately, the location of the deer trail was relatively open and we could get a signal to help us find it, and that trail was well enough defined that we could take it all the way to the cache. Even though my GPS was still reading something like 365' to the cache, I managed to find the cache because Mean Gene had assured me that his GPS said we were close to the right area. TNLNSL.

to get to this cache. Do not park on the highway; you will get a
visit from the local police. From here head down the trail toward
the cache. Once your gpsr reads close to a 90 degrees turn to the
cache look for a small trail heading into the brush. Do not cross
the fence or enter a mowed yard. If you try this any other way you
will experience heavy bushwacking.&lt;br&gt;

You are looking for a five gallon bucket located on private
property with permision.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The landowners request that we do not make an obvious big trail
onto their property. Please respect this and don't break branches
or do any clearing to get to this cache. If it is to thick to walk
through you are going the wrong way. If we do not comply with this
they will ask us to remove the cache.&lt;br&gt;

Twisted Tree trail (cache namesake) or the White Oak trail. No

typical woodalnd fasion. You are looking for a regular size

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Geocaching with Mean Gene and The Rooter in Springfield on an unseasonably warm Memorial Day weekend. Last cache of the day, and I was more than a little tired. Mean Gene assured me that we had time for “just one more cache” and that this one was only a 700' walk from the parking lot. I'm sure that we went twice that distance along the trail just to get there, but the hike was level and the trail easy to follow. Mean Gene found the cache, and we headed back to the van and on our way home. He was right – we got back to Saint Louis only 7 minutes later than we had originally planned. TNLNSL.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;ULTIMATE GUY COMEDY MOVIES&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve decided to create a series of caches based on lines from the ULTIMATE GUY COMEDY MOVIES! Women may or may not like these, but to be considered a real man, you need to have seen each of these movies (often several times). To meet the requirements, the movie has to have stood the test of time (be at least 10 years old) and be a great movie for guys (sorry ladies, but we don’t always get into those “romantic comedies”). You can keep Hugh Grant, give me Mel Brooks or John Belushi any day!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These will not be at the exact location, but will be somewhere nearby. To find it, you have to figure out the movie which will then give you the exact coordinates. Once you find it, you will need to provide your own writing instrument and log it. Finally, when you get home, you may have these lines stuck in your head and might feel an overwhelming urge to watch the move again (for the 142&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; time). Feel free to give into these urges!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coordinates:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;N 39 45.2AB&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;W 89 32.C93&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A = What does one count to before throwing a Holy Hand Grenade?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B = the third number of the year the movie was released&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C = the last number of the year the movie was released&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;i&gt;Why here? Check out the street names.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Geocaching through west-central Illinois with Mean Gene and The Rooter on a delightful Memorial Day Weekend. This was one of our three favorites on this trip. We happened to drive within 5' of the cache, only to find that we're in the middle of a crowd of folks who, while busy in their own activities, were curious about the newcomers in their midst. 

We turned off the car engine, opened the doors, popped the trunk and casually grabbed a cold drink from the cooler. While the car doors and trunk were open, Mean Gene somehow snagged the cache and brought it with him to the back of the car, where we casually signed the log like nothing unusual was going on. 

Returning the cache was nearly as easy; the local man closest to us was by then working near the back of his car, and two other folks had finished their chores and left the area, leaving only two others, who were no longer paying any attention to us. Whew! Cool cache! TNLNSL. Thanks, TeamCooper! roelsch -- St. Charles, MO.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Cache is a medium size rubbermaid container. You do not (and should
not) cross the fence to get to it. &lt;br&gt;
 History: As you enter the cemetary take a left. The second stone
(closest to the road) marked A.H. and Julia Crocket is the location
of David's (of TeamCooper) great great grandparents graves. After
finding the cache go straight north about 40 yards and you see an
old stone marked John and Julia Popp (John's second wife). This is
the location of David's great great great grandparent's grave. Near
this is a stone marked Susan J Popp (John's first wife, also
David's great great great grandmother). You also might see an old
stone marked Robert Billings. This is the grave of David's great
great great great grandfather. Many of the stones around these are
aunts and uncles. &lt;br&gt;

a well stocked big cache is nice also). This is located just off
Route 29 not far from Interstate 55. It would make a handy travel
stop. It is located on business property with permission and help
from the owner. There is no need to go near any buildings or cross
any fences. Your search should be whithin the gravel lot and not in
pasture.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">During a drought in 1838, 850 Potawatomi Indians were force-marched from Indiana to Kansas.  During the march, 40 of their tribe died.  They made an encampment from September 4 to November 4, 1838 here at Island Grove.  One child died on October 1 and is buried there.

The cache is located at Island grove at the coordinates listed above.  The cache is close to but not at the historical marker memorializing the event.  The marker is located 1/4 mile west and across the road.  You may drive but if you walk to the memorial, please be careful of the traffic.  The marker is located at 39 45.814 and 89 57.391. If you do not wish to visit the memorial, you may see a picture of it here.

This cache was recently destroyed but has been relocated.  It is located in the woods and has been covered and disguised as well as possible.  If you find it, please secure and re-hide it.  It is a clear plastic jug with a blue screw-on lid and was re-started containing two books, "Procyon's Promise" by McCollum (scifi) and "Light Raid" by Willis and Felice (scifi).  It also contains a few toys, GPSr food and of course, the log book.  It’s a pretty area and has a great historical significance.  Learn and enjoy!

We drove to within 300 feet or so of the cache, then hiked through the woods to find the item mentioned in the clue. The cache almost jumped out at us, since it was only lightly covered and we had plenty of light from the noonday sun. TNLNSL. Thanks, eddie-the-razor! roelsch -- St. Charles, MO.

New roads have been built which would make it easier and quicker to get here, but my dad wanted to be driven on the same route as his parents and his grand parents at the time of their death.  I always take the same route to get there and this truly is the last bridge to cross before they went home.</groundspeak:long_description>

My kids were so excited to come home and tell me they were taking a geocaching class in school, they of course already knew all there was to know about it, we had been caching for 2 years prior to the class, so they loved being able to speak up and tell the teacher this lol...Thank you for that!

There are trails throughout this area and I advise you to follow them they will make these caches easier to locate. They are all a little off the trails. Please put all caches the way you found them.  Do not attempt this cache if the river is flooded you will not be able to get to one of the caches but it is high enough it should not be affected. The terrain is only rated so high because I am sure if you take a different route it may be more difficult and it's a decent hike.

*FTF There is a gift card awaiting you, so what are you waiting for?  The rest if full of swag and kid friendly.  

Round trip you will travel about a mile so leave plenty of time to finish all stages.  

You will not need to go over any fences, roads, or through any trespassing signs.  I would suggest long pants to avoid posion ivy and itch weed.  Follow me and you will find it and let me know how it was the is out first multi-cache hide.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;ULTIMATE GUY COMEDY MOVIES&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continuing on with the ULTIMATE GUY COMEDY MOVIES! Women may or may not like these, but to be considered a real man, you need to have seen each of these movies (often several times). To meet the requirements, the movie has to have stood the test of time (be at least 1990's or earlier) and be a great movie for guys (sorry ladies, but we don’t always get into those “romantic comedies”). You can keep Hugh Grant, give me Mel Brooks or John Belushi any day!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These will not be at the exact location, but will be somewhere nearby. To find it, you have to figure out the movie which will then give you the exact coordinates. Once you find it, you will need to provide your own writing instrument and log it. Finally, when you get home, you may have these lines stuck in your head and might feel an overwhelming urge to watch the move again (for the 142&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; time). Feel free to give into these urges!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coordinates:&lt;/p&gt;

Even though we've had problems finding Mr. Ori caches in the past, we included this series on our route. This one was nasty, but something raised Mean Gene's suspicions and a hand tool from the TOTT kit confirmed his intuition.

Back at the van, the aglet (that's a crossword puzzle word -- look it up) from The Rooter's jacket got smashed into the hatch lock at the back of the van, forcing an unscheduled delay in the route and, coincidentally, requiring the same TOTT hand tool to effect the aglet-ectomy.

We did [i]GCHBZT Sangamon River Canoe Launch[/i] near here in 2004 and can remember the campers all over down by the river back then; today the river was in flood all over the campground instead. The Dollar Store mirror didn't spot this one, but the unaided eyeballs did. TNLNSL. Thanks, mjipitch, for placing this cache! -- roelsch, St. Charles, MO.

While caching I met Jason, a local muggle who lives very near GZ and is aware of the cache. After a pleasant conversation with Jason, he offered to show me the cache since I failed to find it. Jason confirmed that it was missing. We searched in the tall grass thinking that perharps it had been knocked about, but we both failed to find it. Although I have to take the DNF, I was happy with making a new friend. Pretty awesome.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;ULTIMATE GUY COMEDY MOVIES&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continuing on with the ULTIMATE GUY COMEDY MOVIES! Women may or may not like these, but to be considered a real man, you need to have seen each of these movies (often several times). To meet the requirements, the movie has to have stood the test of time (be at least 1990's or earlier) and be a great movie for guys (sorry ladies, but we don’t always get into those “romantic comedies”). You can keep Hugh Grant, give me Mel Brooks or John Belushi any day!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These will not be at the exact location, but will be somewhere nearby. To find it, you have to figure out the movie which will then give you the exact coordinates. Once you find it, you will need to provide your own writing instrument and log it. Finally, when you get home, you may have these lines stuck in your head and might feel an overwhelming urge to watch the move again (for the 142&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; time). Feel free to give into these urges!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coordinates:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;N 39 40.ABC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;W 89 32.DEF&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A = the third number of the year the movie was released minus the last number&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B = the first number of the year the movie was released&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C = how many wheels Eddie's ride had&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D = the number of nights that pass during the movie&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E = the third number of the year the movie was released minus the firstnumber&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;F = how many females have major roles in the movie (remember the servants)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why here? Looks like the location at the start of the movie.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">In a small Nebraska town of thirty nine people, there was a man named Rick and his son Shawn who decided to go Dove hunting. Rick was celebrating his 50th birthday, and Shawn his 29th. They decided to drive separately because Shawn had to get to work early that afternoon. They were five miles from home when they got a call from their Muther.

Rick Was in his ' 89 Dodge truck, and Shawn in his ' 30 rat rod. Muther told Rick that he shouldn't be too late because he was taking her to the movies at six, and that she wanted to take the 69 Mustang so she can cruise with the top down, like the good old days.

Shawn and Rick had such a good time, they left one of the doves sitting in a tree, as they sped off to make Muther happy!

It has a 50M gallon capacity and is 80ft tall from the bottom of the tank.  This cache is also located in a nice little community park, that we have taken advantage of several times.  Also, there is a Veteran's Memorial across the street that is definitely worth checking out.
  The cache container is an ammo'd matchstick holder.  Please hide as you found it, and be wary of muggles.  Happy Caching!</groundspeak:long_description>

Been on a run of DNFs lately so I hoped this one should be a sure thing.  Easy find, but my phone died as I was about to snap a picture.  Somebody left behind some neat foreign coins (I left them all for another cacher).  If you are reading this, stop in to Village Hall and say hello to the Mayor and Village Clerk!

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Located on 48 acres in southern Menard County, IL, Starhill Forest
is a private arboretum owned and operated by the Sternberg family
since 1976. The land has been farmed and grazed since the mid-19th
century, when Abraham Lincoln traveled on the same road during his
New Salem days. 
&lt;p&gt;Old trees in the forested areas date to about 1850, and the
oldest planted trees were started from seed in 1964 and
transplanted from another location. Permanent records kept by
Starhill Forest include provenance information, propagation method
and year, mapped location within the arboretum via a surveyed grid
system, and other data. In addition, permanent records of other
taxa that have been tested and have not survived include cause of
death, when known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary scientific collection is a quercetum (oak)
comprising the living reference collection recognized by the North
American Plant Preservation Council. Additionally, approximately
150 other genera of woody plants are available for study, as well
as herb and perennial landscapes, a native prairie garden, several
provenance tests, and a conifer plantation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Recently I received an email from a cacher from California.
A portion of the message follows.

"I live in San Bernardino California and I am in the process of creating a Travel Bug in memory of my mother "Lois Kensinger" . She passed away this year and always wanted to travel back home and also the world. She was born in Divernon in 1931. My travel bugs mission is to travel home to Divernon and then the Springfield area and then around the world."

MapRat and I placed this cache to honor his mother and to give his travel bug a place to come home to.  We scouted the area and placed several caches in "her" home town. We hope to have her travel bug here in Springfield so we can take it "home" and then let her travel the world from here.  
I hope you enjoy the caches we placed in the area.</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This white oak, Quercus alba, has been core-dated approximately to
the 1750s and probably sprouted from its acorn during the French
and Indian war. It has been a landmark tree along the road to the
Sangamon River since the earliest settlers came to this area. The
tree was found to be splitting a few years ago, and a group of
volunteers donated time and money to preserve it and place a
monument here.

There is no purpose in this, other than to give Dad monkey something to do while driving to and from work. We thought that after driving past these locations over 3,000 times, that dad probably knew some spots to drop a few caches.

Walla - The Commute Series. This series will have caches appearing along I72 (for the most part) between Decatur and Springfield. Sometimes the challenge will be finding the cache. Sometimes the challenge will be trying to figure out how to get there. Sometimes there will be no challenge at all.</groundspeak:long_description>

Even though there was traffic on the Interstate, we were all alone on this dead-end service road. Mean Gene let me out to search for the cache while he turned the car around. I hadn't found it quite before he got back, but spotted it within a few more seconds. TNLNSL. Thanks, Fab5 Flying Monkeys, for placing this cache! -- roelsch, St. Charles, MO.

Now we have a new hobby GEOCACHING which we are having alot of fun doing. This cache is placed in a little harder spot than our usual hides and be careful because your feet could get wet if it has been raining. Please be careful when parking for this cache. You do not have to park on the main roadway. (Route 29) 

This cache owner:
- Maintains thier own caches. Please advise if there is a problem.
- Appreciates logs that are not cut and pasted :) Be creative
- As always PLEASE be careful out there

Good luck and Happy hunting!!!

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">All of you local Springfield Cachers likely spotted right off that this isn’t a new cache.  We decided that the cache is really nice, but the multi was pretty lame.  Cut us a break, it was our first try.  Now, we’re redoing Goldenwood as a regular cache.  There’s no need to re-find it if you already have – it hasn’t really moved.  If you must, because you just can’t sleep nights knowing that there’s a cache number that you haven’t gotten a smiley for, by all means come on out and ‘find’ it. We wouldn’t want you to be driven to insomnia. 

Once you find an address rock that includes the name of the cache, you are getting close. These woods have suffered much from the bad weather of the last two years, and three major trees, and dozens of smaller ones have fallen, making the coordinates much easier to dial in than when the canopy was full. The cache is on private property with homeowner permission, and the closest neighbor is aware of the cache, so just wave and keep on hunting. There’s no need to go up the drive past the alarm company sign, but that will leave you plenty of hunting space.

These woods are home to 5 species of woodpeckers, 3 types of owls, and all sorts of other woodland birds. Goldenwood is a Cornell University feederwatch site, and data is kept on dozens of bird species of birds every year. These downed trees are cover for rabbit, squirrel, chipmunk, opossum, raccoon, turkey, coyote, turtles….   and thousands of mosquitoes.  Also watch out for nettles and poison ivy – please limit your hunts to the daylight hours.</groundspeak:long_description>

This one was a Favorite for the look on the guys faces when I walked up and found this previous DNF that THEY had.  I Just walked up and there was an out of sort kinda thing. What a hoot!  It was a really good hide.    OCW Trekto and Rainman on a 368 mile "Out of Town Tuesday" session.  Found a bunch of really neat caches and enjoyed the Decatur area.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Geocaching with Mean Gene and The Rooter on a second trip to Monticello, on a sub-freezing day with 35- to 40-mph wind gusts from the north to nip at your nose, toes and fingers – perfect geocaching weather! We must have missed something or perhaps were numb from the cold, but we only found one part of the final coordinates (broken into four or five pieces). We read and re-read the notes and scoured the logs, but saw no indication of what we were missing, so we moved on to the next cache. Thanks, notrax1, for placing this cache! -- roelsch, St. Charles, MO.

When we got there, wes37 was at GZ, but still looking... but not for the cache. He was looking for the cache log, which had blown out of his hand and was nowhere to be seen. With a good breeze blowing pretty steadily as it was, this one could be in Jacksonville by now. We never did find the log, so we put in a ill-fitting replacment.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Geocaching in west Central Illinois with Mean Gene on what started as the coldest weekend of the winter – but fortunately for us, it warmed up to just freezing by mid-day; perfect geocaching weather! We had a DNF on this one back in May and were wanting to get back and straighten that situation out, The coordinates are off to the north by 30' or 40', but with the hint, which I don't think we had back in May, it should be an easy find. Someone, I suspect a townsperson, has even provided a dead giveaway hint, once you get close enough to see it. TNLNSL.
