Stepping off the train, the Union soldiers were unable to locate the perpetrators, so they returned to the Wentzville Hotel to treat the wounded. The train was again attacked the following morning as they tried to continue west. After fighting off the Buchwackers, the train continued on to Mexico Missouri to link up with Col. Franz Sigel.</p>\n<p>I've linked to an interesting article on Missouri Bushwackers (also spelled Bushwhackers) if you are interested in learning more.</p>\n<p>The cache is only large enough for the log, so please bring a pen or pencil with you.

It is used as an educational area for local schools and has a nice wildflower garden.</p>\n<p>The coordinates will take you to a log bench where you can sit and enjoy the flowers and ponder why I'm making you do math. To find the actual coordinates, you will need to learn a bit about Fibonacci numbers. Many patterns in nature, including snail spiral shells resemble Fibonacci spirals which can be created by drawing circular arcs connecting the opposite corners of squares in the Fibonacci tiling. The Fibonacci tiling is drawn with squares whose side lengths are successive Fibonacci numbers. In some sequences, the first Fibonacci number is designated as zero with the second and third as one. For the purposes of this geocache I'm using the convention that the first and second Fibonacci numbers are 1 and 1.</p>\n<br />\n<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://img.geocaching.com/cache/large/cb7923a7-f666-462c-9e0b-a4bf013e4e0d.png\" />\n<div align=\"left\"><br />\n<div align=\"center\"><img />\n<div align=\"left\"><br />\n<p><font size=\"3\" color=\"green\"><b>Both the North and West coordinates are sums of Fibonacci numbers.

Once fish populations have stabilized, the seven-acre lake will be opened for fishing.</p>\n<p>The park is also home to two grass multi-use athletic fields designed for soccer and football and two synthetic multi-turf athletic fields designed for soccer, football, and lacrosse. There are concrete paths around the lake, three pavilions, and a boardwalk. There is also a Storybook Walk and interpretive signs to educate the public on green infrastructure. I've seen ducks, egrets and songbirds in the area.</p>\n<p>The cache is only large enough for the log, so please bring a pen or pencil with you. Wentzville Park hours are dawn to dusk.

Heartland park is home to ball fields, a concrete walking trail, and various green infrastructure elements to manage and treat storm water runoff for a large drainage area. The seven acre lake will host fishing once the fish population has stabilized.</p>\n<p>The coordinates will take you to a sign describing the sediment forebay for the lake. I was recently walking in another location where a similar structure was under construction. I was wondering why there were rock barriers across the lake and when I saw this sign here, I realized what they were for. Read through the information on the sign and determine how many of the statements below are true. \u00a0</p>\n<p><font size=\"3\" color=\"green\"><b>Let X = number of true statements.</b></font></p>\n<p><font size=\"3\" color=\"green\"><b>A = (20 times X) - 1</b></font></p>\n<p><font size=\"3\" color=\"green\"><b>B = (6 times X) + 1</b></font></p>\n<p><font size=\"3\" color=\"green\"><b>For the final coordinates, add A to the last two digits of the North coordinate, and subtract B from the last three digits of the West coordinate.</b></font><br /></p>\n<p><font size=\"3\" color=\"black\"><b>How many of these statements are true?</b></font></p>\n<p>1. Sediment forebays require regular maintenance.</p>\n<p>2. The primary reason the water is slowed is so mosquitos can breed, providing food for the fish.</p>\n<p>3. A sediment forebay is designed to keep debris suspended in the water.</p>\n<p>4. A dike made from large rocks separates the forebay from the lake.</p>\n<p>5. Without the well maintained forebay, the lake would eventually become too shallow for fish to survive.</p>\n<br />\n<p>Cache container is a 180 mL lock n lock container. It contains a log book, a hand carved fish rubber stamp, and an ink pad. Please bring your own pen or pencil. I have added a few pieces of swag and a hand made fish geocoin for the first to find. Wentzville Park hours are dawn to dusk. Please try to be stealthy and rehide as found.</p>\n<br />\n<center><a href=\"http://www.geochecker.com/index.php?code=06944d8a095e0e771850541bc4f4aefd&amp;action=check&amp;wp=47433743473056&amp;name=426577617265204669736821\" title=\"Click here to check your solution on GeoChecker.com\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://www.geochecker.com/banner_plusstats.php?code=06944d8a095e0e771850541bc4f4aefd&amp;auth=aeb4afff87070d3e538e33912d71f941\" width=\"300\" height=\"75\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Click here to check your solution on GeoChecker.com\" /></a>.\n<center><br />\n<div align=\"center\">\n<p><font size=\"3\" color=\"green\"><b>Congratulations to N0WNV for First to Find!</b></font><br /></p>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<p><font size=\"3\" color=\"red\"><b>PLEASE LEAVE THE STAMP AND INK PAD IN THE CACHE.

He jumps the little curb on the left by the yellow pole indicating not to drive there and parks near GZ.  Darn it I'm thinking as I park nicely on the side of the road. I'm thinking this guy really wants this more than me. As I approach he has a boulder over his head and I'm thinking yikes.  I said hello and he said what are you doing and I said geocaching what are you doing?  He thought I was there to yell at him about his parking and taking rocks for his landscaping.  So after a quick explanation on both our parts I had cache in hand by 6:08pm. TFTC and another adventure:)"

This is by far the prettiest coyote I've seen and I wondered if it might be part wolf. I read that coyotes could be distinguished from wolves by how they hold their tail when running: coyotes down and wolves straight out. Checked the cam for other images and had quite a few with him running with his tail straight out. So hmmm.....</p>\n<p>Further research seems to indicate that wolves and coyotes are interbreeding in some areas, leading to hybrids referred to as coywolves. I doubt this is one, but it is interesting to ponder the possibility.</p>\n<p>This letterbox hybrid is located in one of Wentzville's newest parks. The park is home to ball fields and will eventually include a series of walking trails and bridge crossings over streams. The cache is at the posted location. Park hours are dawn to dusk.</p>\n<p>Cache container is a 470 mL lock n lock container. It contains a log book, a coywolf stamp, ink pad and a pencil.

Traffic was not my friend today.  What should have been a 30 minute drive took almost an hour.  Arrived at the park and it was empty.  Off we went and entered the wooded area to start searching.  My phone reception was horrible...of all days to run off without the gps!  The phone kept circling me around the same 30-40 foot section so I put it away and started searching.  Saw a spot that just looked right but nope.  Checked a couple other spots and nope.  I was beginning to think the phone was just way off and was planning the next area to search.  Just as I was about to move on I spotted a little gap and decided to check it.  Glad I did!  Retrieved the cache and opened it up to see a very nice cache assembly.  Opened the log and found a nice blank log; my favorite kind!  Inked the log and put it all back together.  Thanks for a fun FTF run, and our September FTF on day one of the month.  Thanks for the FTF prize & the cache!"

Stopped at this new park to grab the few caches placed here. \n\nI loved everything about this cache! Really enjoyed reading about woodpeckers to gather the necessary information, and as a volunteer with the Missouri Department of Conservation, I liked the reference MDC web page. The hide was the best part. The sun was just starting to go down which made the wooded area a little dark, We pulled out flashlights to aid in the search. I thought I knew where to search sticking with the theme of the cache but this still took some careful looking to discover the container. Very well done! A favorite point indeed!\n\nThanks, OohLookItsARabbit!"

Meaning if you found it in 2009 you can't go back and find it in 2011 and count it for this challenge.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>All \"found it\" logs that have a date that is earlier than the date a cache was published will be excluded from calculations. Meaning, if someone \"found\" a cache a year before it was published, it is not lonely.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If there is a discrepancy between the physical log book and the cache page, the physical log book wins</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You can sign the log anytime you wish, but do not log the cache as found until the requirements are met</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Please post a list of your five qualifying caches with their gc code, name, date found previously and the date you found it in your log (pictures would also be nice, but are not required)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Any logs that do not meet these requirements will be deleted</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This challenge is rated a 5/5 because most of the lonely caches are difficult to get to and/or find. \u00a0The actual cache placement itself is a quick park and grab that is wheelchair accessible. \u00a0Parking is available within 25 feet of the cache.</p>\n<p>Note: There are various GSAK macros that will help you determine your lonely cache finds, but they all require that you have at least one found log before yours downloaded into your gsak database.</p>\n<p>FTF Honors go to Arthur &amp; Trillian!</p>"

It's more fun if you have someone to drive out to grab a cache. So, I convinced two of my caching buddies to venture forth to find their own set of five lonely caches. Fortunately, each had been with me for some of my lonely finds and as such were able to claim those as their initial lonely caches.\n\nWith only a few more to go between them, I decided to wait so we could all go make the final grab together.  Both have now finished the task of turning five frowns upside down.\n\nUnfortunately, one of our number was unavailable to make the trek out with us today, so she will pick it up next week on our way that direction on another caching adventure.\n\nFor this find, my other partner and I drove out to Wright City to claim our prize of the final cache and add our signatures to the logsheet.\n\nWhen we arrived, my compass showed that we were about 75 feet away, pointing through the wooded area.  As we were deciding what to do, we heard a plaintive noise coming from the brush.  A cat was watching us and began meowing for a few minutes before rushing off deeper into the foliage.\n\nSince we could do nothing for the fleeing feline, we headed into the treelike, shoving aside branches and bushes.  It didn't take me long to realize that I had completely misjudged the location of the cache.\n\nGrumbling at my rookie error, I broke free of the greenery and walked right up to the location I should have gone to in the first place and made the grab.\n\nThanks for issuing this challenge to bring some lonely caches back to life as well as helping me to add another 5/5 to my D/T grid."

What better way to end the day than to locate a new multicache in town?  A short drive soon saw my arrival at the intended coordinates.  After parking my car, I discretely walked up the hill as a family gathered at the shelter below.  The needed info was jotted down.  So far so good!\n\nAh, now the second waypoint was quite familiar!  Care was taken with calculating the final location for this hide.  Still, the coordinates seemed odd.  An error was corrected giving the true destination.  I opted to drive rather than walk; the sun had set and time was fast running out!  Dodging other park visitors, I finally arrived and found what was undoubtedly a hidden geocache.  Huzzah!  Signing my name to the log, all was replaced as discovered.\n\nThank you for this well done multi, DPHickey!  It was a lot a fun and a good way to close out my caching for the month of September.

I put my plans on hold and immediately made my way to Cosmo Park.\n\nI arrived at the first stage a couple minutes later and went to work. I got the numbers I needed to advance to the second stage, and it was there I made my way next. Once there, I studied the object, again got my numbers and working with them, I found I had a suitable set of coordinates for the final cache.\n\nI made my way to the area for the final and began my search. I found the cache container quickly and retrieved the log. To be honest, I wasn't surprised that I was FTF, seeing as how I was on site mere minutes after publication and I saw no one else as I was working out the numbers. Nevertheless, I am always pleased when I find a blank log, and this time was no different.\n\nI happily scribbled my name on the log sheet, took a couple pictures and set out to do the tasks I had come to Columbia to do. Thanks for a fun multi, dphickey! You get a favorite point for sure!\n\n-Fulton, MO"

The public telephone is one example that has been a constant companion since its inception as a pay device by William Gray in 1889. Two were in use within the University of Missouri's repository of knowledge, Ellis Library, until recently. And it is there our journey through a brief history of these devices begins.</p>\n<p>The above coordinates are Ellis Library's west entrance doors where one of the payphones once stood. Inside the second set of double doors is a directory on the south wall (to the right). Find the telephone number for Cynthia Cotner, and jot down the last three digits. Using these digits, we will locate a microfilm in Special Collections.</p>\n<p style=\"clear:both;\">Assuming the three digits from the phone number are <b>Z</b>, the call number is as follows:</p>\n<p>Spec. Coll. Microfilm Rm. 406<br />\nFilm Book <b>A B</b> Reel <b>C</b> Frame <b>D</b></p>\n<p><b>A</b> = Divide Z by 3, then add 80<br />\n<b>B</b> = Multiply Z by 3, then subtract 86<br />\n<b>C</b> = Using the last two digits of Z, subtract 2 and then divide by 13<br />\n<b>D</b> = Subtract 47 from Z, then divide by 2</p>\n<p>Room 406 is found on 4 West. The quickest route is to walk past the bookmark cafe on the ground level and turn left after the security office. Follow the hallway and ignore any doors encountered until the two silver elevator doors are in sight. Take them (or the nearby stairs) up to the third floor (3, not 3R, on the elevator). Take a left on that floor and follow the hallway up the half flight of stairs to Special Collections. Room 406 is at the end of the hall on the left. Microfilm readers may be found in rooms 403 and 404 in that same hallway.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://mulibraries.missouri.edu/guides/virtour/virtourindex.htm\">Maps of the building can be found on the website here</a> (and should clarify things a bit).</p>\n<p style=\"clear:both;\">The microfilm in question contains a short history of the telephone industry and its struggle with monopolizing. Using information on the various frames, you will determine the hiding place of the cache container. It is located on floor <b>E F</b> (where F is a cardinal direction) near the sign reading <b>GH I</b> (where G and H are parts of the same word). There are two of these signs on that particular floor, and the cache is nearest the one next to a <b>JKLM</b> (once again, JKLM are all components of the same word).</p>\n<p><b>E</b> = In footnote #9, transpose / switch the digits of the page number<br />\n<b>F</b> = On page CRS-2, third paragraph, ninth word, first letter<br />\n<b>G</b> = On page CRS-6, fifth paragraph, ninth word, third letter<br />\n<b>H</b> = On page CRS-4, first paragraph, fourth word, last four letters<br />\n<b>I</b> = Divide the page number in footnote #7 by 3<br />\n<b>J</b> = On page CRS-5, third paragraph, fifteenth word, first letter<br />\n<b>K</b> = On page CRS-5, third paragraph, eleventh word, second and third letters<br />\n<b>L</b> = On page CRS-6, fourth paragraph, fifth word, first two letters<br />\n<b>M</b> = On page CRS-6, fourth paragraph, first word, first letter</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://img.geocaching.com/cache/cdacd6fd-924e-4a26-bc3c-bd7d073a0e23.jpg\" alt=\"Ellis Library West Wing\" style=\"float:right;margin:0px 0px 10px 10px;\" />When finished, please return the microfilm to its box and place it in a return area in Special Collections.</p>\n<p>Please note that, at the final location, nothing needs to be opened to find the cache container. Also, it will not be hiding on or within any shelving (so books and shelves can be ruled out). Be mindful of people studying nearby and be as quiet as you can. It's a library, after all.</p>\n<p><i>Permission for this cache has kindly been provided by Director of Libraries, Jim Cogswell, and Head of Security and Facilities, Patricia Jones.

To answer the first part, at least $1.00 if you follow my hints and have a close parking space, and $2.00-$3.00 if you don't. Once I found the right book, the cache was a piece of cake, and very enjoyable. I felt like a little kid being entrusted with adult equipment! While it was fun, it made me grateful for Google and the ctrl+f function that computers provide. This cache shouldn't have taken me any time, but I didn't read the directions well. I used the first 3 numbers instead of the last 3, and got her phone number from the phone book that was next to the complimentary phone,  rather than from a directory. So I had the wrong phone number, and couldn't find a corresponding book, because the numbers were too high. I also couldn't figure out how a single film book could have 2 numbers A and B! I couldn't figure out how to put the numbers together to make one number that made sense. I kept going back and forth between the two phone numbers figuring Z both independently and cumulatively, but the figures just wouldn't jive. After working at it for over an hour, I finally figured out that] B is a year and not part of the film book number! [At that point a number that I'd crossed out was the only possibility, and all the other numbers relating to that one fell into place! That was the perfect place for a cache; muggle resistant yet easy for a geocacher to spot. I left a Columbia College lapel pin, and took nothing. Thanks for a creative hide!]\n\nThis entry was edited by Tony Banks on Thursday, 09 January 2014 at 04:33:20 UTC."

A letterbox cache in a library may not seem to some to be a memorable cache, but for me, this one definitely was.  \n\nMy quest began on Sunday, when, after checking the schedule online and seeming to find that the place was open from noon to 2 a.m., I arrived in the early afternoon to find that the building was locked up and impervious to my attempts to enter.  No problem!  I had to be on campus all day in just a few days (today), and I figured I could make the find then.  So, I skipped what I am sure was a delicious lunch served by the University Club, I believe, and headed over, again, to the mathematical sciences building.  I was able to negotiate the entry doors today, but when I arrived at the appointed room, I found it locked with a sign reading \"Open M-F, 1-5 p.m., closed Saturday & Sunday.\"  Great.  I had to be back at 12:45, so it was off to Ellis to try to find another cache, and this one would have to wait until my work day was done.\n\nShortly after 4:30, I made my way back to the mathematical sciences building, and to the second floor.  Success!  The lights were on and the door was open.  The librarian was speaking with a patron, and, since I came with the proper call number in hand, I started searching (almost as if I knew what I was doing).  Within moments, the patron left, and I heard the librarian walking my way.  I figured if she asked, I'd level with her because I was pretty sure she knew about the cache.  She said, \"May I help you find anything?\" \n\nI sheepishly told her that, no, I was looking for something that she may or may not know about--a geocache.  She said, \"Oh, I know about it.  I can't tell you where it's at, though.\"  I thanked her and set off searching again.  I found the call number I was looking for, and searched the area carefully.  No joy.  I checked the hint.  Hmmm.  Checked the definition.  Hmm.  The one pattern I saw and tested got me a \"I can tell you it's not there,\" from the librarian.  I searched and thought, thought and searched.  Nothing made sense to me.  So, I acted on a hunch, and there it was.  I was so close to heading out the door and telling the librarian I was a moron.  I'm glad I didn't.  I thanked her and headed out the door, moving toward the stairs, when someone followed me out into the hall and called me out.  I turned around to see Unitzoid, the cache owner.  He asked if I had found something else.  I said I hadn't, and we went back inside to discover it.  This is definitely a cache that really took some doing to log a smiley.  Thank you for placing it, Unitzoid!"

You may temporarily disable your cache to let others know not to hunt for it until you have a chance to fix the problem.  This feature is to allow you a reasonable time,[b]  normally a few weeks , [/b] in which to arrange a visit to your cache. In the event that a cache is not being properly maintained, or has been temporarily disabled for an extended period of time, we may archive or transfer the listing.\"  \n\nThanks for your understanding.\n\nWhen you have made all repairs, please  remember to post an \"Owner Maintenance\" log on your cache page. This log restores the cache to its fully-functional state and allows your cache to be shown in the search results of Pocket Queries. Don't let your cache be filtered out unnecessarily in Pocket Queries by forgetting to re-set the attribute!\n\n\n[B][green]Most problems can be solved with good communication so reply back to the reviewer and we will do everything possible within the guidelines to get your cache published. It is best to give me as much information as possible instead of saying nothing at all. This will speed up the process and we can get your cache published.

Any recorded finds doing so may be deleted without warning!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Report of a bank robbery in Mexico, Missouri was brought to the attention of Boone County Sheriff Wilson and State Trooper Ray Cushman while meeting with a reporter from the Columbia Tribune concerning an incident earlier that morning. Sgt. Booth of the newly minted Missouri State Highway Patrol called the pair from Midway, Missouri and suggested staking out the intersections of U.S. 63 and 40 in Columbia. They were joined by Deputy Pleas Wright and split up to cover both interchanges. In 1933, the two roads combined briefly on the north side of town.</p>\n<p>Posted at the northern intersection, Booth and Wilson spotted a southbound 1932 Ford V8 coupe with two occupants. Booth signaled the vehicle to stop and approached the passenger side. What the Sergeant noticed is unknown; he then opened the door and attempted to pull the passenger out of the car. A Colt pistol was drawn in the struggle by the suspect, and Booth was shot in the leg. Both fell out of the vehicle and into the grass. Alerted by gunfire, the Sheriff unholstered his firearm and missed hitting the driver twice. The driver reciprocated firing two times through the windshield striking Wilson in the head. Wrestling continued between the Sergeant and his suspect as the driver left the vehicle and shot Booth in the back. Seeing that the officer was still alive, the Colt was leveled at him but jammed. Expletives were shouted as the passenger shot Booth in the chest using the driver's .38 caliber revolver. Rifle fire was evaded from a nearby service station owner as the Ford coupe sped away east down the road. Cushman and Wright, not knowing of what transpired, did not stop the vehicle as it passed them; radio technology of the time did not allow quick communication. Sheriff Wilson was pronounced dead on the scene, and Sgt. Booth passed away soon thereafter at the Boone County Hospital.</p>\n<p>Two days later, an open memorial service was held at the Boone County Courthouse between 10 AM and 1 PM. Over three thousand paid their last respects with Judge W. M. Dinwiddie leading the ceremony. Many spoke, and the prosecuting attorney assigned to the case, Wood Sapp, promised to pursue the criminals to the fullest extent of the law despite prior stated objections to the death penalty. Both Dinwiddie and Sapp were close friends to the Sheriff and pallbearers at his funeral one and a half hours later.</p>\n<p>Finding the killers would be a two year and one day long process with many leads that seemed to go nowhere. Witness accounts from both the scene and a gas station in Englewood, Missouri provided a license plate number (351-746) and basis for Captain Lewis M. Means, the State Highway Patrol's first Captain, to begin an investigation. He left his post in Moberly, Missouri to pursue the case and succeeded in obtaining a confession from Francis McNeiley proceeding many aliases and dead ends. McNeiley later indicated the other assailant and passenger as George McKeever who was serving a ten year prison sentence in North Dakota. As it turned out, neither were involved with the bank robbery in Mexico. Their plan had been to steal from a bank in Columbia, drive on and shoot anyone that got in their way.</p>\n<p>The subsequent court cases in January and June of 1936 gave McNeiley a life term in prison for cooperation and McKeever an death sentence after a trial in Fulton, Missouri. Judge Dinwiddie presided over the later case with W. Sapp prosecuting and McNeiley participating as a witness for the state. McKeever's execution was the first in Callaway County since 1858 and protested by the citizenry. Alice Booth and Core Wilson, widows of the dead officers, along with two hundred and fifty others witnessed the last legal hanging in Missouri at an old barn near Fulton. The widowed displayed no emotion. Mrs. Wilson would later state that she \"would have felt better if the other one had been up there, too.\"</p>\n<hr />\n<p style=\"font-style:italic;\">Permission was obtained to place this geocache; the area is only available from 6 AM to 11 PM.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Additional Waypoints</p>"

Then I looked up the cache page (OK, I was looking for a hint), saw knitfobb's log about a new location.  Wha??\n\nReading on, I saw I was going to have to recalculate the coordinates.  Then I couldn't remember exactly what the cities were, so I had to go to the posted coordinates and recalculate from there, only to find that I would be going back to within 0.1 mile of the previous location.\n\nFinally arrived at the final location, a target-rich environment.  And muggle city.  I found a cool arrowhead, and with as many people that were going by, I thought I might have to settle for that.  Then I saw something that didn't look quite right, waited until I could explore it unobserved, and there she blew.  Signed the log as quickly and nonchalantly as I could, though I have to admit, one older couple stopped before I had completely reassembled everything - she asked if I was measuring something!  I feigned being a rockhound, after all, I had the arrowhead to prove it.  Of all the subjects to open up with this couple, I picked the wrong one - turns out he was a retired geologist, and we talked for five minutes about stuff I wasn't at all qualified to comment on.  Eventually they moved on, I hastily rehid everything fully, and beat feet the heck out of there.  \n\nThanks for the adventure, Unitzoid.  Geocaching leads to some one-of-a-kind encounters!"

He elects to begin at Flat Branch Park, the starting point of the MKT trail. The drive is punctuated with a sigh; the trail runs a good length of 8.9 miles out to Hindman Junction. Parking and unloading his bike, Unitzoid begins cycling at 9:28 AM. A downhill grade speeds him up to 15.12 miles-per-hour.</p>\n<p>Approaching Hindman Junction at 9:31 AM, Atomic Goat's Breath steers his bicycle off the Katy Trail and onto the endpoint of the MKT. It has been a good day! After 26.6 miles of riding from North Jefferson City, he has yet to lose pace. Atomic Goat's Breath looks at his GPS and notes that he is riding at an easy 25.6 miles-per-hour.</p>\n<p>If Flat Branch Park is considered mile marker number 0 and Hindman Junction is mile marker 8.9 on the MKT trail, at which mile marker will Unitzoid and Atomic Goat's Breath meet?

The short term benefits of bug repellent have been proved by scientists, while the rest of my story has no basis more reliable than my own meandering experience. I will commence telling my story....now.\n\nI was at home when my phone rang with an e-mail notification. I expected a cache, because it was sent to a groundspeak specific e-mail account. I was surprised to see that it was less than 10 miles away, and a Unitzoid puzzle cache no less. I grabbed a nearby empty doughnut box and a pen, and set myself to the task. I made quick work of the puzzle, and then ran it through the geochecker. Incorrect!? How dare it! Could Unitzoid have made a mistake? Nope, definitely something I forgot to take into account. Solved it again! Again, incorrect! I went to take a shower hoping it would clear my head. Of course! I forgot to add that part back in. Success!\n\nI knew that Arthur would be hot on my trail, so I sent him a message. He'd already solved it, but was not seeking the FTF. He's not the only cacher in the area, but many in this area shy away from puzzle caches. I don't know why. ;) I set off toward the posted coordinates opting for the shortest driving distance. The trail was packed with muggles, and I feared that finding this cache on a day like this would draw a lot of attention to myself and its hiding place. When I arrived at my first good opportunity to leave the trail, I realized that that fear had been unfounded. Close to 300 feet away through knee high plants. There were closer points to leave the trail, but this appeared to be the easiest. My first step in I took a spider web to the face. In retrospect it saved me a lot of trouble as I was forced to reevaluate my route. \"What would cachers approaching from the other side do?\" I wondered. I crossed the bridge and found a deer trail. While I stood contemplating this way in, the mosquitos were quickly honing in to the CO2 I was releasing. I scratched my neck, and found blood on my fingers. To time to think about it was done. I slipped on my way up, and grabbed a stick to wave in front of my face after walking into a second web, and nearly a third. Eventually, the path ran in to a small trail, which led to civilization! Those of you who know me know that I have second thoughts every time I step off a sidewalk on to a mowed lawn. I don't care much muddy trails, giant flies buzzing around my head, and mosquitos drinking my blood. That's why it was so hard to leave that paved path to find the cache, but I did! The container was well hidden, and the swag was both impressive and relevant to the theme of the puzzle. I signed the log, and begrudgingly started back down the path that brought be there smacking and grabbing at mosquitos, and crashing face first into a spider web right before stepping back on to the main trail.

I loaded GSAK with a fresh PQ and sent it to my GPSr but the only caches on the GPSr were two in STL.   UGH...

I really love the letterbox hybrids, so I was excited to get this one going.\n\nSo, I began my quest. I read the instructions carefully and took off. I climbed and climbed some more, taking pictures of the awesome view as I went along. I identified the needed trees (a big shout out to my mushrooming, because by necessity you learn tree identification) and inched closer to the prize. \n\nI got to ground zero just fine and found the container. Quickly, I had log in hand and I was delighted to find a log book with the FTF spot wide open and untouched! I happily signed my log, put everything back and scooted on back toward home.\n\nThanks, Unitzoid, for the fun cache and puzzle! I award a favorite point for it. TNLN/SL TFTC!\n\n-Fulton, MO"

At least I made the grab!\n\nI was here at this park last night and explored up this way. This very lookout was also where a couple had strung a hammock and was enjoying the view and lovely February weather. Looked very relaxing. \n\nThanks for the cache!\n\nL pencil"

[How to do EVERYTHING.](http://support.groundspeak.com/index.php?pg=kb.chapter&id=22)\n\n----\n\n##_**To BE ARCHIVED VERY SOON**_##\n\nGreetings cache owner,\n\nWe noticed that your cache has been temporarily disabled for a period of time well in excess of the period of \"a few weeks\" as contemplated by the cache guidelines published on the Geocaching website.\nWhile I feel that Geocaching HQ should hold the location for you and block other caches from entering the area around your cache for a reasonable amount of time, we can't do so forever.\n\n\n#_**quote:**_#\n\n----\n\n_**From the guidelines...      \"... As the cache owner, you are also responsible for physically checking your cache periodically, and especially when someone reports a problem with the cache (missing, damaged, wet, etc.). You may temporarily disable your cache to let others know not to hunt for it until you have a chance to fix the problem. This feature is to allow you a reasonable time \u2013 normally a few weeks \u2013 in which to arrange a visit to your cache. In the event that a cache is not being properly maintained, or has been temporarily disabled for an extended period of time, we may archive this listing.\"**_\n\n----\n\nIf it is not disabled already,  I will temporarily disable  it, to give you an opportunity to stop by and check on your cache.\n\nIf you haven't had time to check on it by my next check I'll go ahead and archive it then. \n\nIf you decide that this project has reached its end you can archive it now to remove it from the active cache database. \n\nWhen everything is OK again, please remember to enable your cache and post an \"Owner Maintenance\" log on your cache page. This log removes the \"needs maintenance\" and allows your cache to be shown in the search results of Pocket Queries. Don't let your cache be filtered out unnecessarily in Pocket Queries by forgetting to reset the attribute!\n\nMaintenance should be completed within the next 30 days or the cache will be considered abandoned and will be archived. \n\nI want to thank you for the time that you have taken to contribute to Geocaching in the past and I am looking forward to hopefully seeing your cache up and running in the near future.\n\n##_**HOW TO RESPOND IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS**_##\n\nRespond by posting a new Note. Go to the cache page in question, and click on Log Your Visit. Select \"Post Note\" as the log type, and enter your message. Doing that, I'll know exactly what cache your message pertains to, which will speed the communication process.\n\nIf you're reading this as an email, don't reply to the sending address. It won't reach me. Follow the contact instructions above.\n\n\n***Thanks a MILLION, Glenn*** \n***\"Seek quality, not quantity\"***\n--Your friendly Missouri Geocache Review team is:\n ***[*gln](http://www.geocaching.com/profile/?u=*gln), [Mongo](http://www.geocaching.com/profile/?u=Mongo) and [Banjo-Boy](http://www.geocaching.com/profile/?u=Banjo-Boy)***\n \n----\n\n\nMissouri Cache Review Team, \n*gln, Mongo & Banjo Boy\n\n{#ff1e78447444be1fff5edb355b978fca}"

We got to GZ and I showed the A tree to A&T and he went to the ledge north and said well it's right here. I was super shocked and said there was no way it was there last night when I searched. We signed the lucky log with our co - FTF signatures. I will say it was a shorter search than the couple hour search last night. Pulled into parking lot at 945 and we signed the log at 950. I guess it could be considered a park n grab when it's there. A&T and I thought since we got lucky on this one we agreed to go after a multi FTF later in the day.

They didn't interrupt my activities and eventually left.  One thing was apparent when searching; someone had been thorough in scattering rocks around the area!

I spent roughly 2 hours between 6am and 9am searching the trees and rocks and one hour standing/sitting around thinking about were the cache could be, and watching the bluejays, buzzards, and woodpeckers. The CO's were concerned about muggles finding the cache, but I can assure them that this cache is safe from muggles and cachers...assuming it's still there. The object of placing a cache is to show people a place of significance. This cache meets that criterion. Thanks, but I'll wait until someone else finds it."

The slopes were treacherous mainly because of the abundance of fallen leaves that hid the loose rocks and were slippery on their own.

Key to such change is the motion of large sections of the surface rock layer, or crust. These sections, known as tectonic plates, move against one another reforming the surface constantly. It is difficult to see in our lifetimes, but, over millions of years, the alterations are quite evident. One way to witness this constant flux is careful study of the planet's current geology.</p>\n<p>Missouri's geology shows a varied past that is easier to observe. Much of the present day rock in the state is sedimentary in nature. Sedimentary rocks are formed from debris left behind in a depositional environment, or a location where particulate matter can collect. Over millions of years, the deposits of soil, grains of sand and past living creatures add up and are compacted in a process called lithification. Water is expelled as pressure increases from upper layers and density increases. Each layer's characteristics can be identified visually by casually looking at an eroded bluff.</p>\n<p style=\"border-bottom:black solid 5px;clear:both;font-weight:bold;\">Tropical Paradise<img src=\"http://img.geocaching.com/cache/a898af06-79a7-4a47-a388-803a55de5eaf.jpg\" alt=\"Section 2\" style=\"float:right;margin:0px 15px 5px 15px;\" /></p>\n<p>This leads us to the bluffs at Capen Park in Columbia, Missouri. They are exemplary, and, to find out why, we'll have to step back millions of years into the past.</p>\n<p>Approximately 410 million years ago, Missouri was tropically located just south of Earth's equator. This was long before the supercontinent of Pangea existed, and the tectonic plates constantly moved landforms around the planet's surface as they do today. A Sloss sequence, or period of sea level fluctuation, began around this time. There were four such sequences during the Paleozoic era (542 to 251 million years ago) that influenced Missouri's sedimentary rocks; we will be focusing on the Kaskaskia sequence that occurred during the Mississippian period (359 to 325 million years ago).</p>\n<p>The Kaskaskia sequence saw radical changes in sea levels during the Mississippian period. Missouri, at the beginning of this time, found itself shallowly underwater catching the nutrient-rich sediment deposited by ancient streams and rivers. Simple aquatic lifeforms consequently colonized the area and flourished. Among them were crinoids, brachiopods, horn corals, blastoids, bryozoan, radiolaria and gastropods. Toward the end of the Mississippian period and Kaskaskia sequence, sea levels dropped sharply dooming this ecosystem to extinction. Tectonic plate collision would reorient the area now known as Missouri further introducing new life and geology.</p>\n<p>Logically, it would seem that future sedimentation and changes in geology would bury the past under layers and layers of rock. Not completely so! Sloss sequences over millions of years ensured uneven exposure and inundation. As some portions were exposed, the easily soluble sedimentary rock eroded and erased eras of depositation. Such action leaves gaps in observable geological history. Others remained buried and untouched for future revelation.</p>\n<p style=\"border-bottom:black solid 5px;clear:both;font-weight:bold;\">Layers of History<img src=\"http://img.geocaching.com/cache/0191381e-19b9-48ad-947e-2069d2c877fe.jpg\" alt=\"Section 3\" style=\"float:right;margin:0px 15px 5px 15px;\" /></p>\n<p>Capen Park exemplifies an outcrop, or a natural surface exposure, of limestone that was created during the Mississippian period and revealed through erosion by Hinkson Creek. When standing at the bottom of the bluff, one will note three distinct features. Starting from the bottom, a layer of lower Burlington limestone was produced between the early and middle Mississippian period. Upper Burlington limestone follows and comprises a majority of the bluff right to the top; it was produced during the middle to later Mississippian period. Small bands of crumbly, white stone known as chert may be found throughout.</p>\n<p>Lower Burlington limestone is fairly easy to identify. It is somewhat fossiliferous, fine to medium grained and brown in color. Impure phases of development as well as ferriginous material lends to the pigmentation. This layer is typically between 10 and 20 feet tall.</p>\n<p>Much more famous and recognizable is the upper Burlington limestone. Highly fossiliferous, the upper member is coarsely crystalline and light to dark grey or brown in coloration. Fossils found are commonly identified as crinoid stems (appearing as segmented straws) that are in actuality calcite crystals. These remains comprise up to 90% of the limestone. This layer is much more imposing standing between 100 and 160 feet tall.</p>\n<p>Chert intermingles freely with both forms of Burlington limestone. The organisms responsible for its creation, radiolaria, excreted silica from the water and thus their remains were filled with the compound. Globules of the stuff collected on the sea floor and were consequently flattened by other sediments layering above. Mostly white or grey, the stone can be discovered in round sections or lensing layers, also known as bands, of irregular length. They are mostly between two inches to two feet tall.</p>\n<p style=\"border-bottom:black solid 5px;clear:both;font-weight:bold;\">Traversing the Trails<img src=\"http://img.geocaching.com/cache/c153961b-10bf-4e8a-8f06-21af9fb88e98.jpg\" alt=\"Section 4\" style=\"float:right;margin:0px 15px 5px 15px;\" /></p>\n<p>Now let's put the above information to practice!

A remnant of that time can be found at the posted coordinates in the form of a limestone boulder.</p>\n<p>1a) On the southern side approximately one and a half feet off the ground, a well-worn and sizable crinoid stem is easily discovered. What is its length?</p>\n<p>1b) Is the boulder upper or lower Burlington limestone?</p>\n<p><b>N 38\u00b0 55.852 W 92\u00b0 19.244</b></p>\n<p>Differences in erosion can be seen at the second waypoint in the upper Burlington limestone.

Using your GPS, measure the elevation at these coordinates and add 8. Then, subtract your answer from the reading taken at the second waypoint. Approximately how tall is the upper Burlington limestone segment?</p>\n<p>3b) How many bands of chert can be identified in both the upper and lower Burlington limestone?</p>\n<p>3c) Define Sloss sequence.

First my GPS wouldn't cooperate with me, and I finally figured out that because I was entering waypoints it was pointing at where I needed to go but not telling me distance.  So I switched over to my old trusty 60CSX and I was golden.   I stuck to the trails mostly after figuring out which trail to take and found each spot.   Finding crinoids without knowing what one was was a bit challenging but a hint from a friend online and I was able to complete the first step.  The second and third steps were not too bad.  I spoke with some rock climbers at the last step, they were repelling off the very spot I needed to measure.   Once at home I did the calculations and they seemed a bit high to me but then again I wouldn't want to fall from that spot so maybe they were.    All in all an interesting cache on International Gecoaching day."

We chatted a bit with them about what we were up to and then gathered up the info as they climbed the layers of geological history on display here.  We went back up top and watched them appear from below as we were working our way up the rock \"steps\" to the second waypoint.  That area reminded us a little of some of the bluffs in the upper peninsula of Michigan where Trekkin' ran wild as a kid.  We studied the rock here, and Birdin' kept enjoying the songs of the Carolina Wrens throughout the woods as we traveled to the final spot.  We also live in karst country and so are quite familiar with these processes, but when traveling, we always find it interesting to see the variation as we move further north or south.

It seems like every time there was a choice of two paths, I headed down the wrong one.  It started with the very first waypoint (negative).  That alone, took me about a half mile off course, as I wasn't yet sure how often the waypoints woul be placed.  Once headed in the correct direction, I cut my off course jaunts to much less distance.  Everything started going very well, until I got to a few waypoints from the end.  I could not find that one picture.  I kept retracing my steps, and after about the fourth time (through light rain for the past hour), I matched the picture, and within scant moment, had the log in hand.

Sometimes you get in trouble for it from an outside source or it's something that could affect you detrimentally on a personal level. All of which applied to me.\n\nFor the last few days, I have been laid up with the flu. Nasty stuff, it is. I really didn't feel like getting out at all, so I was a true homebody. During this time I endured all the classic symptoms of influenza. Today, though, I didn't feel so bad. Sure I was running a real low fever temperature, but otherwise I felt okay. \n\nRummaging through my meds for my timed dose, I discovered I was going to run out of a very important medication that I need daily. Problem is, the place I get it from in Columbia is closed on Sunday. Drat. Well, I had to suck it up and go to the drug store and get my meds, so I headed that way. While waiting in line at the drive through, I got the notification of a new cache...in Columbia, even!\n\nSo, I got through the line, bought my meds and figured what the heck...I'll got for the cache! I was here anyway and if I was gonna kill myself today, at least make my trip worth it. [:D]\n\nI got to the appointed parking area, bundled up a bit and set out for the posted coordinates. After studying the cache page, I knew what I had to do and found the first point...and the second...the third...and so on. Sometimes the items in the pics were kind hard to spot, but all in all it went smoothly in the beginning. \n\nThen, at one point it started getting harder. Oh yeah...that bit about making assumptions is very true. By this point, my eyes were trained to look for detail, and as the cache progressed, these skills were more and more utilized. Often, I had to stop and double check to make sure I was seeing what I thought I was seeing. \n\nFinally, I got to the area of ground zero and within seconds I let out a war whoop and I had cache in hand! I slowly unrolled the log and was greeted by a pristine log sheet! I happily signed the FTF spot, put everything back in it's rightful place and started back to the parking area.\n\nAll in all, this cache took about two hours or so to do. There were a few times that I went astray, so I had to double back and try something else. \n\nAs I said in the beginning, there are often consequences for your actions. I got in a bit of trouble with Trillian for being out sick (her feelings assuaged by me buying some Wendys...for now) and I am not sure if I made myself worse. Time will tell, I guess. No matter what, this is a great concept for a cache and I am happy to have done it. Well done, Unitzoid! This one certainly deserves a favorite point, which it will get.\n\n-Fulton, MO"

After running some errands with Ben we made our way to the park and hiked our way to GZ.   I had Ben stay up top and away from the steep hill that the cache was hidden on the side of.  My first approach was to try to come down from the top from the right hand side of the cache.  This was a mistake.  The steep incline added to the muddy leaf covered rocks and ground made for a scary situation.  After 2 failed attempts I decided to call the CO and see if he had any advice.   After a brief discussion I went north east or to the left of the cache and found a less scarier approach.  Finally at GZ I spotted the tell tale signs of geocover and cache was in hand.  The cache itself was very muddy and slippery but that did not stop me for signing the log for the smiley and today's special souvenir.     TFTC"

I'd remembered Unitzoid mentioning that it had been stolen and replaced, and asked Arthur if he had Unitzoid's number. The muggled cache had been retrieved, and new one was still well hidden. Rachel signed a log book or perhaps both, and we sauntered off down the trail in search of the music. \n\nAfter arriving at GZ, I'd like to brag about how quickly I found the cache, and how Rachel and Arthur (who'd already found it) were surprised and accused me of having found it before. The truth is I was was somewhat petrified with fear. The leaves were slippery, and I am afraid of heights. When Rachel found the cache, I threw our only pen at her. She caught it, signed the log, and although I eventually got up the courage to join Michael and Rachel, I never did check the log sheet to confirm that my caching name, rather than my real name, had been written on it.

I was chatting with yoyoteacher and others about the cache when I had an epiphany! I told everyone to hold on and very soon after yoyoteacher said the same thing! Since both of us had a musical background, we knew exactly what to do. Final coordinates were soon in hand, and thought of going for FTF were discussed. Those thoughts were soon dashed when we saw the FTF log come through the network. No matter, it would surely be a great cache to find any time.\n\nThis afternoon was that time. It started to rain as I walked to the cache location. I looked for a couple minutes here and there, rechecked my GPSr unit and what do you know? I saw something that looked just a bit odd. Turns out it was the cache container! I signed the log happily, put everything back as it was and set off back for the car.\n\nThanks for the cache and the fun, Unitzoid!"

       "#text": "<b>In a little corner of eastern Columbia, you\u2019ll find a most interesting sight that few likely see. Looking upon a section of exposed bedrock, one can see evidence of a valuable mineral used the world over in many applications. That mineral is iron. How did it get there? How do we even know it\u2019s there, anyway? Before we answer those questions, let\u2019s learn about iron and its role in geology.<br />\n<br />\n<font size=\"5\" color=\"brown\">What is iron, exactly?</font><br />\n<br />\nIron is a chemical element with the symbol Fe (Latin: ferrum) and atomic number 26. It is by mass the most common element on Earth, forming much of Earth's outer and inner core. It is the fourth most common element in the Earth's crust.<br />\n<br />\nIron exists in a wide range of oxidation states, from -2 to +6, although +2 and +3 are the most common. Elemental iron occurs in meteoroids and other low oxygen environments, but is reactive to oxygen and water. Fresh iron surfaces appear lustrous silvery-gray, but oxidize in normal air to give hydrated iron oxides, commonly known as rust. Unlike the metals that form passivating oxide layers, iron oxides occupy more volume than the metal and thus flake off, exposing fresh surfaces for corrosion.<br />\n<br />\nIron metal has been used since ancient times, although copper alloys, which have lower melting temperatures, were used even earlier in human history. Pure iron is relatively soft, but is unobtainable by smelting because it is significantly hardened and strengthened by impurities, in particular carbon, from the smelting process. A certain proportion of carbon (between 0.002% and 2.1%) produces steel, which may be up to 1000 times harder than pure iron. Steels and iron alloys formed with other metals (alloy steels) are by far the most common industrial metals because they have a great range of desirable properties and iron-bearing rock is abundant.<br />\n<br />\nIron also plays an important role in biology, forming complexes with molecular oxygen in hemoglobin and myoglobin; these two compounds are common oxygen transport proteins. Iron is also the metal at the active site of many important redox enzymes dealing with cellular respiration and oxidation and reduction in plants and animals. A human male of average height has about 4 grams of iron in his body, a female about 3.5 grams. This iron is distributed throughout the body in hemoglobin, tissues, muscles, bone marrow, blood proteins, enzymes, ferritin, hemosiderin, and transport in plasma.<br />\n<br />\n<font size=\"5\" color=\"brown\">Where do we find iron?</font><br />\n<br />\nMost iron is found right beneath your feet in the Earth\u2019s crust, particularly in sedimentary rocks. Iron-rich sedimentary rocks are sedimentary rocks which contain at least 15% iron. Most sedimentary rocks, however, contain iron in varying degrees. The majority of these rocks were deposited during three specific geologic time periods: The Precambrian (3.8 billion years ago to 570 million years ago), the early Paleozoic (570 to 410 million years ago), and the middle to late Mesozoic (205 to 66 million years ago). Despite the multiple periods of in which they are deposited, they make up a very small portion of the total sedimentary record.<br />\n<br />\nIron-rich sedimentary rocks have economic use for the iron ore contained within. Iron deposits have been located on all major continents with the exception of Antarctica. They are a major source of iron and are mined for commercial use. The main iron ores are from the oxide group consisting of hematite, goethite, and magnetite. The carbonate siderite is also typically mined. A productive belt of iron formations is known as an iron range.<br />\n<br />\n<font size=\"5\" color=\"brown\">What are the main types of iron formations?</font><br />\n<br />\n<i><u><font size=\"4\">Ironstones</font></u></i><br />\n<br />\nIronstones consist of 15% iron or more in composition. This is necessary for the rock to be considered an iron-rich sedimentary rock. Generally, they are from the Phanerozoic which means that they range in age from the present to approximately 540 million years ago.<br />\n<br />\nThey can contain iron minerals from the following groups: oxides, carbonates, and silicates. Some examples of minerals in iron-rich rocks containing oxides are limonite, hematite, and magnetite. An example of a mineral in iron-rich rock containing carbonates is siderite and an example of minerals in an iron-rich rock containing silicate is chamosite.<br />\n<br />\nIronstones typically exhibit these features:<br />\n<br />\n\u2022 They are often interbedded with limestones, shales, and fine-grained sandstones.<br />\n\u2022 They are typically nonbanded, however they can be very coarsely banded on occasion.<br />\n\u2022 The components of the rock range in size from sand to mud, but do not contain a lot of silica.<br />\n\u2022 They are not laminated and sometimes contain ooids. Ooids can be a distinct characteristic though they are not normally a main component of ironstones. Within ironstones, ooids are made up of iron silicates and/or iron oxides and sometimes occur in alternating laminae.<br />\n\u2022 They normally contain fossil debris and sometimes the fossils are partly or entirely replaced by iron minerals. A good example of this is pyritization.<br />\n\u2022 They are smaller in size and less likely to be deformed or metamorphosed than iron formations. The term iron ball is occasionally used to describe an ironstone nodule.<br />\n<br />\n<i><u><font size=\"4\">Iron formations</font></u></i><br />\n<br />\nIron formations must be at least 15% iron in composition, just like ironstones and all iron-rich sedimentary rocks. However, iron formations are mainly Precambrian in age which means that they are 4.6 billion to 590 million years old, so they are much older than ironstones.<br />\n<br />\nIron formations usually follow these characteristics:<br />\n<br />\n\u2022 They're well banded and the bands can be anywhere from a few millimeters to tens of meters thick.<br />\n\u2022 The layers have very distinct banded successions that are made up of iron rich layers that alternate with layers of chert.<br />\n\u2022 They are often associated with dolomite, quartz-rich sandstone, and black shale.<br />\n\u2022 They sometimes grade locally into chert or dolomite.<br />\n\u2022 They can have many different textures that resemble limestone. Some of these textures are micritic, pelleted, intraclastic, peloidal, oolitic, pisolitic, and stromatolitic.<br />\n\u2022 In low-grade iron formations, there are different dominant minerals dependent on the different types of facies. The dominant minerals in the oxide facies are magnetite and hematite. The dominant minerals in the silicate facies are greenalite, minnesotaite, and glauconite. The dominant mineral in the carbonate facies is siderite. The dominant mineral in the sulfide facies is pyrite.<br />\n\u2022 Most iron formations are deformed or metamorphosed simply due to their incredibly old age, but they still retain their unique distinctive chemical composition; even at high metamorphic grades. The higher the grade, the more metamorphosed it is. Low grade rocks may only be compacted while high grade rocks often can not be identified.<br />\n\u2022 They often contain a mixture of banded iron formations and granular iron formations. Iron formations can be divided into subdivisions known as: banded iron formations (BIFs) and granular iron formations (GIFs).<br />\n<br />\nThe above classification scheme is the most commonly used and accepted, though sometimes an older system is used which divides iron-rich sedimentary rocks into three categories: bog iron deposits, ironstones, and iron formations. A bog-iron deposit is iron that formed in a bog or swamp through the process of oxidation.<br />\n<br />\n<font size=\"5\" color=\"brown\">How was iron deposited into the rock?</font><br />\n<br />\nThere are four facies types associated with iron-rich sedimentary rocks: oxide, silicate, carbonate, and sulfide facies. These facies correspond to the water depth in a specific marine environment. Oxide facies are precipitated under the most oxidizing conditions. Silicate and carbonate facies are precipitated under intermediate redox conditions. Sulfide facies are precipitated under the most reducing conditions. There is a lack of iron-rich sedimentary rocks in shallow waters which leads to the conclusion that the depositional environment ranges from the continental shelf and upper continental slope to the abyssal plain.<br />\n<br />\n<font size=\"5\" color=\"brown\">How does iron chemically react to the environment?</font><br />\n<br />\nCommonly, the presence of iron is determined to be within a rock due to certain colorations from oxidation. Oxidation is the loss of electrons from an element. Oxidation can occur from bacteria or by chemical oxidation. This often happens when ferrous ions come into contact with water (due to dissolved oxygen within surface waters) and a water-mineral reaction occurs.<br />\n<br />\n<font size=\"5\" color=\"brown\">On to the Earthcache!</font><br />\n<br />\nBy now, you should have a good understanding of what iron is, how it\u2019s formed and its uses. Let\u2019s apply what you\u2019ve learned! Two distinct sections of rust-colored rock stand before you, indicating that very nearby, iron-rich rock resides. Look at these bands and refer the the material you\u2019ve just read to answer the following questions. <font color=\"red\">Failure to answer the questions and then sending them to the cache owner will result in the finder\u2019s log being quietly deleted.</font><br />\n<br />\n1. On average, how wide (in feet) are the two streaks of oxidized iron before you?<br />\n2. Looking at the rock face, you can easily tell where it\u2019s coming from. About how high is the rock layer from which the oxidized iron is emanating?<br />\n3. Describe the process of oxidization.<br />\n4. How much iron does the average man and woman have in their body?<br />\n5. In what three periods of Earth\u2019s history were the majority of iron-rich rocks formed?<br />\n<br />\nA picture of yourself posted at the site would be nice, but it\u2019s not required.<br />\n<br />\nHappy caching!<br />\n<br /></b>\n<center><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/gs-geo-images/ef8d16df-59cf-4ccd-9c7c-72667a6fbc1a.jpg\" /></center>"

Next, measure with your ruler from the base (not including the stem) to the tip. Your measurement should be made to the closest <b>even</b> centimeter <i>(for example, 2.5 would be 2)</i>.

So I went out to refind and replace my cache in it's proper spot.  I needed a find for this weeks challenge to get 10 points finding a multi in the Mary Hyde promotion.  So the closest Multi was this one.   Now I seem to have issues with Unitzoid Multis and this would once again prove true today.   I found the first spot, made my measurements, did the calculations and head off for the next stage.  .4 a mile away I realize that the GPSr is pointing me way off trail.   Knowing that it was probably on the trail I sat down on a bench and reread the cache page.  I noticed the mistake I made.  Crap.  Back to stage one to find the right info and recalculate.  Once back at stage one I realized I had no clue what the CO was asking for.   No problem, we are friends.... PAF.   The CO happily answered his phone and couldn't quite help.  He hadn't looked at the cache in a while and didn't remember what was needed.  No problem he said, he'd meet me out there as he was biking around.   After a brief wait (Man can Unitzoid ride a bike) he showed up, gave me a lesson on tree anatomy and corrected one of my measurements and we had some working coordinates.   So back off down the trail.   It's always fun caching with Unitzoid as we always seem to have interesting conversations.  Next thing I know we are .1 from the cache and I look up and there was the bench I first sat down on and figured out I was missing a calculation............   ISAG   Cache in hand log was signed and then we went back to stage one where my car was parked.  Thanks for the conversation and the cache Unitzoid.  One of these days I'll figure out how to finish your multi's without help."

I checked it out, and was happy to see it was a new Unitzoid cache, as he always makes them interesting. \n\nI'd already had a good caching day with a pair of FTF's this morning, so it was that remaining bit of adrenaline that caused me to think of going for this cache. Hmmm...it was almost nine. Could I get it done in time and still be all sorts of legal and be out of the area by 11 p.m.? I think I can! \n\nLET'S GO!\n\nI scurried on down the road and in what seemed a blink of an eye, I got to the appointed parking area. I hopped out of the car and I raced my way down the trail and got to the spot. I have a good headlamp, so vision was not an issue. I found what I was looking for and began upon my calculations. I came up with a set of numbers that seemed legitimate, so I set off toward the final, hoping I was right.\n\nAs my compass counted down the feet, what came in view pretty much confirmed in my mind that I was on the right track. I searched a bit and whammo...there was the cache! I speedily opened the container and extracted the log sheet. Yes! It was clean! \n\nI happily scribbled my name on the log, put everything back as it was and then left ground zero with 50 minutes to spare!\n\nThanks for the fun multi, Unitzoid! Favorite earned! Thanks also for bringing us out on a new section of trail, too!\n\n-Fulton, MO"

Deep within the shaded wood of Greensbriar Hollow lives a cantankerous troll. His domain once stretched far throughout the valleys of what is now known as Hinkson Creek. Travellers and settlers avoided this area knowing of the potential danger that lay in wait.</p>\n<p>As time passed, people grew more numerous and became more courageous. No longer were they afraid of what may be found in the darkness! Farms were built, and the inhabitants generally kept to themselves. This suited the troll just fine; he could pick off the occasional treat and none would be the wiser.</p>\n<p>The town of Columbia continued to grow, and the countryside was ripe for development. Barns were soon replaced with an overabundance of homes and subdivisions. The troll was soon overtaken; never had he seen such gigantic and monstrous machines! His retreat forced him into the hollow of Greensbriar, a small refuge from the civilization surrounding it. Setting up his home, the troll believed himself finally safe albeit confined.</p>\n<p>One final incursion, a bicycle and hiking trail, was the last straw for the troll. No longer would he hold himself back! The machines created by humanity would not torment him further! This is how the monuments of the hollow came to be. Should an individual ride through on their bicycle, they should beware! Their beloved conveyance may become a new trophy for the troll to display as a warning to others.</p>\n<center><img src=\"http://img.geocaching.com/cache/27bc5a5a-2bf5-4a45-978a-1d4155174220.jpg\" alt=\"Greensbriar Trail\" style=\"margin:5px 0px 15px 0px;\" /></center>\n<p>Should you be brave enough to seek this cache, you will need to find one of the \"trophies\" close to the posted coordinates hanging upside down. There are many; be sure that you have the right bicycle! Using your keen sight, make the following observations.

Nothing came up so I used my PAF access and called the CO.  After a brief discussion it was obvious we had the wrong bike.  Benbot99 was with me so we trekked back down to the area and he spotted the correct bike.   Some quick recalculations and the GPS told me the cache was about a mile away.   No that's not what the CO said.   Recalculate and try some different answers nope.  Still just under a mile away.  The CO said he'd join us if we were still in the area after a certain amount of time so we went back to the bench on the hill and I tried to figure my errors out.  First I noticed I used the wrong operator on one of the answers, still way off..... Finally I tried adding the waypoint into c:geo and that was much closer to what the CO described.  I did a brief search of the area until Benbot99 started complaining about bugs.   So we decided to head back to the car and get bug spray, but just then the CO arrived and I was able to determine that some I changed one of the numbers that should not have been changed on the GPS and ended up with the same coords I was just searching.  Another search ensued and I finally spotted the elusive cache.  Thank you Unitzoid for all the help.   Something about your caches makes my brain go mushy.  TFTC"

I would have thought the constant downpour would have washed it off, but no such luck.  \n\nOnce I realized my error, I recalculated this morning, and decided to look in the correct location.  I arrived just as the rain was letting up, and had checked several locations, A&T arrived on the scene, and we began searching cooperatively.  In no time, we narrowed down the location and A&T spotted the location of the hide.  The rest, so they say, is history.

I figured that someone would get the FTF on it, anyway, so I would just get it the next time I was in town.\n\nLast night, though, I looked at the cache. I was able to use some information available to me and extrapolate a set of coordinates. So, knowing I was going mushrooming today, I figured I'd go after it. \n\nUpon arriving at the trailhead, I set down the trail. Fairly quickly I saw tasmo dutifully searching for the cache in the spot I had pinned down for ground zero (turns out my math was a bit off, but not by much). I called out greetings to him and soon after, we agreed to go at the cache together.\n\nWe searched high, low, to and fro without much luck until I checked a hunch. That hunch paid off with the cache container! Opening the container, we were presented with a pristine log! Scribbling our names on the FTF spot, we put everything back and headed to our vehicles. We paused for a while to chat about this and that before going our separate ways.\n\nThanks for the fun cache, Unitzoid! TNLN/SL TFTC!"

Stand on the sidewalk and face the park. This is the darkened wood through which you must venture! Will you find the hidden treasure or walk aimlessly along the circular trails forever? Your only salvation from such a cruel fate is to follow these directions carefully:</p>\n<p style=\"font-variant:small-caps;\"><b>A</b> paces West-southwest <b>|</b> <b>B</b> paces Southwest by South <b>|</b><b>C</b> paces Southwest by West <b>|</b> <b>D</b> paces West-northwest <b>|</b> <b>E</b> paces Northwest <b>|</b> <b>F</b> paces Northeast by East</p>\n<p>The prize awaits where you will come to a rest.

Start from either parking location (Dublin Avenue is closer) and make your way to the coordinates. There, you will discover a fairly new park bench. A small plaque at the center lists a couple of dates. Take note of the oldest year.

Good! Let the year equal <b>ABCD</b>. For example, if the year is 2003, <b>A</b> would equal the first digit, 2, <b>B</b> would equal the second digit, 0, and so on. Take these numbers and substitute them into a couple of easy arithmetic equations.</p>\n<p><b>E</b> = <b>B</b> - <b>C</b><br />\n<b>F</b> = <b>E</b> + <b>A</b></p>\n<p>Now, plug your values into the following coordinates:</p>\n<p>N 38\u00b0 56.<b>FEB</b> W 092\u00b0 23.<b>CDA</b></p>\n<p>It is at this location that you may find the geocache!

After reading about the nasty little insects that like to sting Geocachers I knew I had to be careful searching for the cache.\nAfter about 15 mins searching with the GPSr bouncing all the place I was about to give up and there it was.\nThis was a very good hide. I signed the log with my borrowed pen.\nThanks for placing this will hidden cache.\nI'm giving this one a favorite.\nNow to return the borrowed pen and start back to Rocheport."
