A first and then cached back to my flight in St. Louis to add Missouri. Like the caches around here. They were well done. Thanks for enabling my addiction.\n\n\nwww.teamnorthwoodsgeocaching.com"

Since we had heard about how we could get these coordinates, we decided to make a stab at this.\n\nYeah... I think we should have done a little bit more research because Road GPSrs showed that we could drive within a few hundred feet of it from the West. No worries though, right? We started the walk on what used to be some sort of road and quickly got to where we would have to bushwack. This is where we should have turned around, but because we are gluttons for punishment, we continued on.\n\nEventually, we had to \"Take the beach\" as Dodgecardoc called it in an email but not before at least one of us sunk in a few inches. Eventually we were presented with an elevation change and we found the cache without incident... for now.\n\nWe then decided to take another way out since we discovered what we saw on top, but that was an even harder way but strewn with caches. That was okay though because we ended up seeing an Eagle's nest out in the woods. \n\nThanks for hiding a fun cache for us to find while in the area!"

I think Wheelinb may have mis-logged this one since there ain't no way to get a vehicle near GZ on this cache.  Was a bit of a hike to get back here, but finally made my way back and found the cache.  It was sitting in the open and had a bit of water in it.  Last log looks like was almost a year ago, surprised nobody from MOGA made it over here.  Dried stuff out as best as possible and put it back under some cover a bit.  TFTC"

Ha ya ok, it's 150 degrees in that timber, the ticks are thicker then all get out, plus it was wet, so i'm soaked making my jeanks weigh 200 lbs, up and down the hills, covered in ticks and spiders, having a heat stroke, I thought my demise was near, then I finally heard those wonderful words, TRISH WHERE ARE YOU! OH thank the good Lord above they are looking for me, so I turned in a 90 degree turn spotted the sun and an opening to the 10 ft tall wet grass that killed your legs to walk through, and made my way to it, spotted Jim and Steph across the field about a 1/2 mile away, and just died, Steph says I lost you Trish i didn't see you anymore, I freaked out, then your head popped back up and I was like OMG thank God she's ok.  So after catching my breath, I started the dreadful walk through that dreadful wet grass, only to find out we are about a 1/2 mile from the jeep and Steph and Jim were gonna go after one last cache, I was like what, are you kidding me i'm about to die, I need a drink, Jim had coffee, haha,  ya ok, that will wet the whistle but isn't gonna rehydrate me, so close by was an old bathroom with a concrete slab to the entrance, in the shade, Jim cleaned it off and said ok sit here it's in the shade, we'll go get this last cache and be back, well while sitting there I was at war with ticks, there was these pretty little purple flowers all around me and i'm thinking the ticks like those pretty little purple flowers because I must have flicked 1000 ticks off me while they were gone for 20 minutes, I finally had enough and Steph had left me her cell, so I got on it and sent Jim a text and said are you guys about done, and then thank the good Lord they were and they were almost back to me, Jim helped me up but before that I said look at this, I had about 15 ticks that had just showed up on my left leg, I said this is what i've been at war with since you've been gone, he and Steph were like holy cow, they  must like those purple flowers, I was like YOU THINK, lol....so word to the wise never let your insane friend plan a caching trip in the end of June because she'll kill ya, and STAY AWAY FROM THE PURPLE FLOWERS IN THE WOODS LOL...j/k Steph, but I told ya I was gonna log that lol!!!  Anyway it was another great day, we had a lot of fun and laughs, i'm glad i survived and noted on the scale another 11 lb weight loss, so thank you for the cache and thanks Steph for getting these lbs off me!!!"

Ha ya ok, it's 150 degrees in that timber, the ticks are thicker then all get out, plus it was wet, so i'm soaked making my jeanks weigh 200 lbs, up and down the hills, covered in ticks and spiders, having a heat stroke, I thought my demise was near, then I finally heard those wonderful words, TRISH WHERE ARE YOU! OH thank the good Lord above they are looking for me, so I turned in a 90 degree turn spotted the sun and an opening to the 10 ft tall wet grass that killed your legs to walk through, and made my way to it, spotted Jim and Steph across the field about a 1/2 mile away, and just died, Steph says I lost you Trish i didn't see you anymore, I freaked out, then your head popped back up and I was like OMG thank God she's ok.  So after catching my breath, I started the dreadful walk through that dreadful wet grass, only to find out we are about a 1/2 mile from the jeep and Steph and Jim were gonna go after one last cache, I was like what, are you kidding me i'm about to die, I need a drink, Jim had coffee, haha,  ya ok, that will wet the whistle but isn't gonna rehydrate me, so close by was an old bathroom with a concrete slab to the entrance, in the shade, Jim cleaned it off and said ok sit here it's in the shade, we'll go get this last cache and be back, well while sitting there I was at war with ticks, there was these pretty little purple flowers all around me and i'm thinking the ticks like those pretty little purple flowers because I must have flicked 1000 ticks off me while they were gone for 20 minutes, I finally had enough and Steph had left me her cell, so I got on it and sent Jim a text and said are you guys about done, and then thank the good Lord they were and they were almost back to me, Jim helped me up but before that I said look at this, I had about 15 ticks that had just showed up on my left leg, I said this is what i've been at war with since you've been gone, he and Steph were like holy cow, they  must like those purple flowers, I was like YOU THINK, lol....so word to the wise never let your insane friend plan a caching trip in the end of June because she'll kill ya, and STAY AWAY FROM THE PURPLE FLOWERS IN THE WOODS LOL...j/k Steph, but I told ya I was gonna log that lol!!!  Anyway it was another great day, we had a lot of fun and laughs, i'm glad i survived and noted on the scale another 11 lb weight loss, so thank you for the cache and thanks Steph for getting these lbs off me!!!"

I found a little opening into the timber and headed for what my gps said was gz. but of course with the coverage above me my gps started bouncing and had me all over the place. once it settled down I spotted it. it was buried in debris. I got it dug , and all was just fine inside. thanks moga 2013 for the hide, and the smiley for me."

As I posted on Facebook, \"This is what caching is about!\"\n\nI called the owner for some help on a DNF on one of his other caches and he said I HAD to go find this one. I have to agree...I HAD to do it! [:)]\n\nThe weather was warm today, even hitting the 60's, but you'd never know it on the way back here. The gate was locked, so I parked the Jeep about .7 away from the cache and started the hike back. I immediately wished I had brought my YakTraks, but didn't think to pack them The lane back was covered with ice and even a couple feet of snow in spots. Once I reached the parking lot the snow was a lot more melted and the trail leading back to the cache was very clear.\n\nOf course, the trail didn't last very long. I finally had to break out the hiking staff and made my way over a creek, up a hill, back down and then across another creek. This was especially difficult since I had a lunch date to keep after this cache. I couldn't show up too muddy now, could I?!?!?\n\nI was still a few hundred feet from the cache when I started contemplating the cache name. Surely there had to be something Bob Vila related back here...right?\n\nYup! There was. I took a little time to snap some pictures and then began my search. That took a while. The GPS had me bouncing around, looking all over until I finally found it. The cache was about 22 feet from where my GPS was pointing, but still a fairly easy find. \n\nHowever, the cache was pretty full of water. I emptied it out and signed the damp logsheet.\n\nI snapped a few more pictures and headed back to the Jeep. This one was the highlight of my day! I haven't been able to do much caching lately and the thought of spending the day doing park and grabs just didn't thrill me. This was exactly what I needed.\n\nIt's going on the favorites list! Thanks for a great adventure!"

I finally thought \"where would the chief hide this\" and that's where it was. I tried to take another GPS reading and it ended up being farther away from GZ than the posted coordinates. Something about this area really seemed to mess with my GPS. I found the cache about 20 ft. north of where my GPS was telling me the cache was. The difficulty rating is definitely getting harder as everything is greening up. No mushrooms, no shed antlers, 3 ticks and fond memories of a cache. Took a different route out and followed some deer trails. BRING YOUR BUG SPRAY FOR THE TICKS! Swapped trackables. TFTC!\n#1538"

After spending more time than we'd like to admit looking around what we were certain was GZ, I reluctantly hit the DNF log on the GPSr.  We turned to head back to the van and Bob said, \"Wait a minute.

While you're here, be sure to check out the nearby cache at historic Purvis Cemetery!  Please note that when Lake Shelbyville is up high, the end of this road may be gated, but you should still be able to park at the parking lot near the gate and walk the road the rest of the way.\n\nBecause this cache is on Illinois Department of Natural Resources land, please also note the following:\n1. Geocache is placed on Department managed property with permission.\n2. Do not place the following items in the Geocache: food items; inappropriate, offensive, or hazardous materials.\n3.

The first three caches have a number written on the cache container and/or log.  You don't necessarily need to find these first three in order, but you will need all three numbers to open the final cache.\n\nCache #2 is placed at the end of a scenic drive through the heart of the Management Area.  This road can be pretty soft and rutted certain times of year, so be cautious and use your judgment if you're driving a car instead of a truck.  Also, part of this roads floods when Lake Shelbyville is up, and in that case, the cache will only be obtainable by water and long hike.\n\nBecause this cache is on Illinois Department of Natural Resources land, please note the following:\n1. Geocache is placed on Department managed property with permission.\n2. Do not place the following items in the Geocache: food items; inappropriate, offensive, or hazardous materials.\n3.

Now to figure out where I want to start tomorrow and find a place to lay my head. Thought I'd get the codes for the final but then discovered the final was a bit more than I bargained for.  But these Kaskaskia Lake views were worth it anyway.  Quick find here. Finishing up MOGA caches I wanted to find, as well as some along the trail.  The weekend was so much fun that I stayed several days later to try and get them all!  And no where near getting them all at that.   Thanks for the cache Horticulture"

You don't necessarily need to find these first three in order, but you will need all three numbers to open the final cache.\n\nThis cache was the first one we placed in the series.  It's near one of the most stunning views of Lake Shelbyville, as well as the start of the Fish Hook Hiking Trail.  Make sure to rehide well.\n\nBecause this cache is on Illinois Department of Natural Resources land, please note the following:\n1. Geocache is placed on Department managed property with permission.\n2. Do not place the following items in the Geocache: food items; inappropriate, offensive, or hazardous materials.\n3. It is the visitors' responsibility to orient themselves with policies and rules pertaining to this Department managed site."

The first three caches have a number written on the cache container and/or log.  You don't necessarily need to find these first three in order, but you will need all three numbers to open the final cache.\n\nThis particular cache is the final in the series, so make sure you have the numbers you need from the other three caches, or you won't be able to open the cache!  The cache is padlocked, and the combination to open it is:\nKaskaskia #1--Kaskaskia #2--Kaskaskia #3\n\nWe placed this cache on a cool, breezy fall evening with the leaves turning beautiful colors.  We spotted a lot of blue herons and even had three deer run right out in front of us on the trail, inspiring the cache name.  We also discovered a grove of ripe persimmon trees, and Little Brother just couldn't resist a taste.  And Horticulture, being true to form, couldn't stop commenting on the GIANT oak and sassafras leaves littering the trail.\n\nBecause this cache is on Illinois Department of Natural Resources land, please note the following:\n1. Geocache is placed on Department managed property with permission.\n2. Do not place the following items in the Geocache: food items; inappropriate, offensive, or hazardous materials.\n3. It is the visitors' responsibility to orient themselves with policies and rules pertaining to this Department managed site.\n\nAlso note that when Lake Shelbyville is up high, the trails across the levees flood, and then the cache will only be available by water."

The view from the levee was a sea of green stretching into the distance to the North and to the South.\n\nThere are a couple of ways to go at this cache.  I chose to park to the East and walk in that way, since I've already visited the \"island\" from the West in my pre-geochaching days.  I believe the hike to the cache was just over half a mile.  \n\nAt ground zero my GPSr went haywire.  Too much overhead cover was giving me erratic readings and had me flailing around over an acre or so of thorn bushes.  Finally, I went back out to the wide, grassy trail where there is a break in the trees, got a bearing and distance, and tromped straight back into the woods using a pace count to measure the distance.  I knew that land nav training from the Army would come in handy some day.  That method got me within 10 feet of the cache, and it was easy from there.  \n\nYou gotta love ammo cans.  According to the logs, this cache hadn't been opened since last January.  When I opened it there was a big hiss as all that dense winter air, which had expanded with the heat and actually pressurized the can, escaped.  Everything was still bone dry inside.  \n\nI signed the log and took out a travel bug which was not included in the cache listing.  I'll see if I can track down its origins and get it back on its way.\n\nThis cache represented everything that I love about geocaching.  It was a good excuse to get out an explore a new route through the woods with the added bonus of a big 'ol ammo can full of goodies at the end of the hike.  I only regret that I couldn't bring the little Hildies on this one.  Deer Island Final definitely gets a Favorite Point from me.  Thank you, Horticulture."

One of the great things about geocaching is all the interesting people you meet along the way.......geocachers as well as muggles.  We met some great muggles on our way to this cache.  They were fishing along the small bank and had some of the biggest fish I had ever seen.  The older gentleman took time out of his fishing duty to explain to us what he was catching and that he wife, although not a big lady, ate alot and that the three ginormous fish laying there would be about three days worth of eating.  I think it was a good thing she wasn't around to hear that comment. lol  As we made our way down the back just a bit we came upon a few teenage boys who had a different approach to fishing.  They were using bow for their adventure.  I had no idea how that was possible.  I myself can't hit the broad side of red barn let along a fish in muddy water flopping around to who wouldn't have it.  Anyway, after we said our goodbyes to those wonderful people we set off to find this little treasure.  What a nice walk it was on a perfect day for caching.  With the combination in had nmekny opened up the little ammo box where we proudly signed our names on the log.  It was a great adventure with my parents and daughter and we can't thank you enough Horticulture for the caches.  SL. [:)]\n\nWanted to add that you get a favorite from us one this one.
