The rain broke up the festivities a bit sooner than we'd have liked but it didn't last long and allowed me to cache a bit more. This was one of the finds for today. \n \nThis was 4 of 14 I found during this cache run.  Thanks golf and horses for placing this cache.  I really do appreciate it. TNLNSL.

We were planning on just a couple days for this trip, but it quickly changed into 4 days and 3 nights of caching from early morning till after the sun went down. We accomplished our goal and now can claim the state of Indiana as all counties found. This would not have happened without all the prep work of Mr. bigcatcog (Thank You). Sheryl(bigcatcog) and I RDC4106 did most of the running and signing of the logs, While Claudia(RDC4106) did the recording, and Mike did the driving and navigating. We really do make a good 4 person team. The bigger logbooks were signed RDC4106 & bigcatcog, while the smaller logs were signed RDCBCC.

We arrived at GZ and spent about 30 minutes looking with no luck, so we decided to throw the towel in and try the other one. As we were driving out, Suzanne spotted a place that matched the description on the page. We pulled over and made the find in a few minutes. We opened the cool container, signed a blank log and got the FTF! [8D] This was our 1st FTF in Illinois! The coords were about 300 feet off, so I emailed the CO with the correct ones. Very nice hide!

I suggested that we stop at this location on the way out and make a quick search.  Unbelieveable!  Cache was in hand.  We opened the container and a fresh log was inside.  FTF with Wizard!

(such a cool/friendly/beautiful dog). we spoke to the guys and they knew what we were there for. i made quick work of it, and then it was off to the next. the cache is in great shape, and is 1 of 16 on the afternoon for us. thanks tonsofcoal for the hide, and the smiley for me."

It was good to see them out fishing instead of getting into some kind of trouble.  An older feller told me that was why he was fishing also...it keeps him out of trouble. \n\n I scared up a great blue heron on my way out while I was talking on the phone and the listener on the other end heard him squawk. \n\nThis could be called goose poop avenue rather than Rocky Road.  Watch where ya step.  Once I got to ground zero it was a pretty easy find.  I shore do appreciate the ammo box caches.  Lots of loot.  I took some stickers for some grand-kids.  Thanks Will for the good cache and the needed walk."

Took the first finder prize and left a couple big army men. Best FTF prize I've ever gotten. Great adventure and well worth the long hike   TFTC\n\nThis entry was edited by Rando60 on Saturday, 21 June 2014 at 19:33:30 UTC."

These cars belonged to all the fishermen fishing in the rain. They must be crazy. Roxy and I found a path along the edge of the lake that I did not know existed. It was made from crushed stone and came to a nice bridge across the cove. From there it turned to dirt and we went up a nice, slick hill.

One of the first things\nwe did when I started hanging out with Gabriel was geocaching in\nfact, the very first Cache we ever found is less the 1500 feet from\nwhere we hid this one. We thought since this was the first Cache we\nhad ever hid, it would be appropriate to hide it near the first\nCache we ever found together. The cache is located at Lake View\npark which is kind of difficult to find if you have never been\nthere. You might ask for directions at the Casey's gas station. The\nnice thing too is there are two caches located here as well and the\nplace is beutiful. My Dad, used to take his Dog out there and play\nhis guitar with his friends there back in the 1970's when he was in\nCollege.</p>\n<p>Anyway this Cache will take you on a nice hike through the park,\nand you can actually keep the lake in sight all the way to the\ncache. It being our first Hide, we thought we would make it a good\none. So this one won't be an easy one to find without the clue. I\nam not a fan of not finding the Cache so after the first to find, I\nwill post a video clue, where Gabriel shows you where it is,\nbecause even after you know, it's still going to be fun to get too\n:] The container is actually a green paintball pod, if your a\npaintball player you will know what your looking for otherwise you\nmight have to google it to find out what it looks like. Original\ncontents are: A brand new in the plastic, with the tag on them,\npair of Panama Jack Sunglasses for FTF, a rubber snake, poker\nchips, a gummy nose and ear, a red pen, a blue pen, a black pen and\nthe logbook.</p>\n<p>You can check out the video about Gabriel and I if you want\nsince were new on the hiding geocaches scene :]. <a href=\n\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99AYGWOTW8E\">See our mentorship\nvideo here!</a> Thanks and happy cacheing!</p>"

His memorial was a beutiful testimony to the life he lived and even the lives he saved.\u00a0Craig graduated from Glenbard West High School 1970. He later graduated from Eastern Illinois University B.S. degree, and St. Louis University School of Nursing B.S.N degree Magna cum Laude. In 1993, he graduated from Bradley University with a M.S. degree in Anesthesia. He worked as a Nurse Anesthetist at several locations, most recently in Palm Bay, FL. Craig especially enjoyed spending time with his sons skiing, playing golf, paintball and of course geocaching. He was a talented musician and enjoyed sharing his gift of music with family and others.\u00a0You can listen to audio of the memorial service <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DVAzaiZtYw\">at this Link.</a></p>\n<p>In the memorial garden's by the Cache you will see a smoke tree which is a symbol of my Father's beutiful life as well as a rock that signifies the importance of the Norman family to him. I still remember the first time I took my Dad geocaching he was floored that people would take so much time to setup the Cache and by how creative people were in hiding as well by how much fun it was to try and find them. I think he would be thrilled that a Cache is setup in his, and that you are taking the time to find it.

No matter what time of year it was, there was always something to see when traveling from class to class.  I enjoyed all the labeled trees, too, and it's nice to see that new students and visitors to campus can still learn which tree is which.  In fact, there is now a plaque in the ground dedicated to the gingko trees just north of the garden highlighted in this cache.  (Thank goodness, our visit was in the spring and NOT when these trees put forth their smelly fruit!)\n\nAs for the cache, we checked out a place or two where we thought the container might be, but when we found it, we saw that there was no place to record our initials, although we squeezed them on.  And we wondered why the recent logs hadn't mentioned anything about the shortage of space... and we wondered why a lot of the dates we saw on that filled log sheet were from 2014.\n\nAs I was putting the cache back where we had found it, trying to get it securely out of sight, my fingers touched something that turned out to be a second identical container.  This one appeared to be a newer one, so we initialed that log, too, and then placed both containers together.  Perhaps the CO would like to pick one of them up to use as a future spare or to place another cache somewhere.\n\nSo that was our adventure at Flowerdoc's garden.  We enjoyed our time in the area today, and we are most certainly glad that there is no passing date on that commemorative stone!  [;)]  Thanks for the hide at \"your\" garden, Flowerdoc!"

To avoid the slight chance anyway, parking on Grant Ave is free."

(trish had almost made it half way when we got it). the cache is in great shape (unlike the structure). sadly this was the last cache of the evening, as the text trish received said we needed to head back home. thanks scarlettsky for the hide, and the pretty quick smiley for me."

I enjoy seeing where and how far they have traveled. \n    This cache listed 10 trackables and all I found was one. I'm visiting from Alaska and had hoped to take them for a visit up there to drop off and leave a few here that I brought down from Alaska. Maybe there needs to be more labeling explaing the trackable process or maybe instructions on the cache page to help people realize that its not part of the swag. \n    I just want to help further these travel bugs to their new destination....Jen"
