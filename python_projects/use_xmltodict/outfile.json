I also determined that I\u2019m not a huge fan of Chicago hot dogs, and that Joliet, Illinois, has a lot of beautiful limestone but is rather oddly laid out.

We liked the old ads painted on the buildings.  And this was a nice historical location.  We thought the cache was in one host at first, but after striking out there, Paycho spotted this somewhere else.  Makes perfect sense.  Nicely done.

The simple outline was the Peoria webcam, all the virtuals near southeast Iowa, and every county in the surrounding area to light up our maps. We had a few possible power runs tossed in for numbers to fill the in between areas including the Iowa Star but Mother Nature and her first major snow storm of the season kind of put a kibosh on all the extras. But we managed to get all the important stuff and had quite a few laughs along the way making for another successful November run!\nSeeing all those favorite points made us put this bugger on our route.

We parked as close as we could, which was near the old baseball field.  OH MY GOODNESS!  The field was so cool!  It has been abandoned for a long time and looked very cool.  The bleachers were built on an awesome old stone wall and the dugouts were terrific!  We took tons of pictures.\n\nThen it was on to the cache.  I found what Paycho suspected this might be, but there was no cache. Paycho spotted that a few hosts down, laying on the ground.  Looks like it got separated from its handle.  The logbook was still inside, so we signed in, and then replaced it on the correct host, but not as originally intended.  This can still be found, but it needs some maintenance to get it returned to its intended working order.  \n\nGiving this one a favorite for the intention, and also for the awesome baseball field.

The name by which it first appeared to the public was <b>Hat Grove</b>, and it covered a piece of ground but a little way from its present site. Its commencement may be dated from the establishment of the post office, with Truman Eldridge as Postmaster. Not until after the completion of the Rockford, Rock Island, and St. Louis Railroad, however, was there much progress made toward a business town.</p>\n<p>A stone with a plaque commemorartes the establishment of Hat Grove in Eldridge Park. The park is named after the founder of the village</p>\n<center><img src=\"https://img.geocaching.com/cache/f2ea367a-d301-4e9e-adec-f0a12aae7f8c.jpg?rnd=0.4014246\" /></center>\n<p>The container is a bison located in the park. Please use stealth and put it back as you found it.</p>\n<p>Truman Eldridge, who now occupies one of the most inviting farms and homes within the Corporation, came, in 1836, from Hancock, Mass., and took 240 acres, a part of which is embraced in the northwest portion of the village. Shortly after he returned to his home and spent two years, and in 1838 returned, and in 1839 he took up, at the government price, 80 acres more, directly north, and in 1850 bought 160 acres more, embracing the northeast portion of the Corporation. The southeast quarter section was bought thirty-four years ago by Solomon Sovereign, and thirty years ago the southwest by John Reeves. The Corporation, one mile square, laid out in streets at right angles, embraces equal portions of these four quarter sections.</p>\n<p>The first township meeting was held in the old Union Church, on April 4, 1854. Truman Eldridge presided at the meeting, and at its close the first township officers were chosen.</p>\n<p>Until the advent of the C. B. &amp; Q. Railroad, almost all the produce was taken to Oquawka, there to be shipped to St. Louis by the Mississippi River. Whenthe railroad was completed trade was changed to Monmouth, and a local trade was started in Roseville.</p>\n<p>Mr. Eldridge gave several lots to those who would erect shops or stores thereon, not a few of which liberal offers were accepted.</p>\n<p>On May 8, 1874, the town had attained a population of 514 inhabitants, and was incorporated. Since then the population has increased to nearly east of the village. Here he commenced work as a blacksmith. Shortly after, he removed his shop to Roseville, where he added to his small shop a room about sixteen by twenty-four feet.</p>\n<p>He soon purchased an engine to aid him in his rapidly growing trade, and increased the number of his employes. About a year ago the present firm was organized, and a still further increase in the buildings and machinery made. Their speciality is windmills, plws and tonqueless cultivators. Quite a number of shops are maintained, good stores, one bank and an excellent flouring mill.</p>\n<p><b>The Schools</b></p>\n<p>The earliest attempts to educate the youth of this community was made in a small log school house, about one mile south of the site of the village. The frame school house east of town was next built. At its location there was a shop and small store, and the residents entertained some hopes of securing a town here. School was maintained here until a few years ago, when it was removed to town and the present edifice constructed. In 1880 a two story building, capable of accommodating two hundred scholars was erected. It was considerd the best school building in the county at the time.</p>\n<p><i>From: The Past and Present of Warren County, Illinois, containing a history of the county\u2013its cities, towns &amp;c., a biographical directory of its citizens, war record of its volunteers in the late rebellion, portraits of early settlers and prominent men, general and local statistics, map of Warren County, history of Illinois, Constitution of the United States.

I searched the whole house - even dug into the couch cushions. NO luck. Finally I called to see about getting a new key. Too Long. So I grabbed my spare key and took off. When I got to the hotel for the night I found the key sitting on the back seat next to my overnight bag. Whew !\n\nI took the slow route to gain more IL counties. Found most but not all I looked for.

After that we went to a new cache in Galesburg and had a great time talking about caching with the owner.  We decided to work on this series again and finished up Biggsville.  We had planned to come back for the southern caches in this series after we went over to Crapo Park for a 4 stage letterbox.  It was all based on Dr. Who.   I had never watched Dr. Who so I had to do a quick crash course as well as figuring out the puzzle.  I finally finished up and found the Tardis at dusk.    I should have had \"The Wumpus\"  go with us.  No time for any more caches tonight.  We stopped at the DQ and headed across \"the pond\" for home."

I searched the whole house - even dug into the couch cushions. NO luck. Finally I called to see about getting a new key. Too Long. So I grabbed my spare key and took off. When I got to the hotel for the night I found the key sitting on the back seat next to my overnight bag. Whew !\n\nI took the slow route to gain more IL counties. Found most but not all I looked for. It was warm which meant mud. Luckily there was snow around to clean my shoes. Thanks owners for placing all the caches.\n I don't think this road is supposed to be open from the north. Then after finding the cache I couldn't go south because there was a truck parked blocking the road. I had to do a 10 point turn on the road to go back north. If I had my truck I would have had to back up the half mile plus to the road. TFTC"

So I drove from Ottumwa, Iowa just to grab this cache this morning.\n\nIt was a beautiful day for a drive, and I stopped to pick up a few caches along the way. My heart beat with excitement that only another geocacher would understand as I crossed the Mississippi into Illinois. I had one anxious thought as I pulled into the rest area: What if I couldn't find the cache? Luckily, my fear was put to rest fairly quickly as I found it tucked away in its hiding spot. My first Illinois find! Thanks for hiding this so near the Iowa border. It made for a fun Sunday morning find! Log and cache are both in great shape. I signed as BBC to conserve space."

A lot of miles and I had to pass many caches that I'll have to save for another day. \n\nBonus cache today,  I love cemetery caches so always target those when I am near-by.  I had read the logs but still surprised by the amount of cactus on this sandy hill.  \n\nI had to hunt for several minutes, coords were pretty good but container was on the ground.  I searched  for a wire or tie to try and see where it came from, but could not spot one. So I left the container wedged into a spot close to my GZ.  However, it will likely wind up on the ground again until secured. \n\nMuggles on 4 wheelers wanted to use the area, but as soon as they saw me, they scampered away. \n\nI loved this spot, thanks for bringing me here\n\nSL TFTC !"
