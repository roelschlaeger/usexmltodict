(front of card)

==============
You are Forty.
==============

You are generous with your time and your love.

You forge onward in spite of exhaustion and despair.

You have a bottomless wallet and unending patience, even when you feel
unappreciated and misunderstood, outnumbered and taken for granted.

WHINER.
-------

Does any of that sound vaguely familiar?? If you replace "Forty" (oops, I keep
typing "Forth" instead of "Forty"... I just did it again! I guess that what
results from having been a **FORTH** programmer for many years of my professional
life)... anyway, replace "Forty" (got it right!) with "a Father" and you would
have the text of a Hallmark card that you sent to me on Father's Day in 1996...
the year that Tiffany and Kevin were married.

"*How can you possibly have held onto that card for twenty years?*" I can hear
you think; "*... and why?*" your thought continues. I cannot answer those
questions; all I know is that, when I was fumbling around to retrieve your
mother's once-in-four-years birthday card from the semi-infinite sink that is my
top dresser drawer, out popped this card -- and I knew I had the basis for this
note to you on the occasion of your fortieth birthday.

Your note on the Father's Day card talked about tuxedoes and reception speeches,
about our father-daughter dance at the wedding, about playing catch in the
backyard, and about the hope that someday it would be you and I at the back of
the church, heading down the aisle into the next unchartered waters.

Your postscript to the card apologized for not having any Father's Day gift,
great or otherwise, and an "*... also, I'd love to do a day trip to Elephant
Rock or somewhere soon, so make it a date!*"

----

We **did** make the day trip to Elephant Rock, perhaps later that same summer.
In those days, before *Google Maps*, we had to use the *Rand-McNally* book of
paper maps for the State of Missouri, but we managed to get down there and back
in once piece, stopping off at a rustic convenience store for sodas on the way
down and stopping for a glass of wine (heavens!) and some conversation in the
late afternoon on the way home.

I recall two other "adventures" of note that we undertook, both of which
illustrate facets of your personality -- and tie right in with the Father's Day
card.

- **STRENGTH**: The first was a walking trip from our house down to the
  riverfront (at Frontier Park?), north on the KATY trail to Olive Street and
  then returning home via Randolph Street past Blanchette Park. I wasn't walking
  regularly in those days, I guess, and by the time we got to Blanchette, I was
  just about worn out. You said that you were tired, too, but you knew we could
  make it, adding: "**I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth
  me.**" (*Phillipians 4:13*).

- **PATIENCE**: The second was much more recent -- a short trip last August with
  you and the boys to *Rock Chalk Park*, just a mile or so west of your house in
  Lawrence. We had planned to search for geocaches in the northwest corner of
  the park but we got stumped on the very first one (which I still haven't
  found).

  The boys were getting bored and impatient and might possibly have mutinied on
  me had I been alone with them, but you made the best of it and convinced them
  to move on to the next cache down the trail.

  The next three caches turned out to be tremendous fun in a dust-y and
  tree-sappy way (translation: perfect for Evan and Caleb) -- Caleb found *two*
  of them and you found the other one *from 40' away*!

A note like this one can not cover the facets of your personality that
have been chiseled and shaped and worked in your forty years. This note **can**
celebrate those forty years with a::
