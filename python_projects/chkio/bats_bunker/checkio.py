"""Compute the minimum distance to the Alpha bat in the bat bunker"""

"""
You are given the map of bunker as a list of strings:
"-" is an empty cell
"W" is a wall
"B" is a bat
"A" is the Alpha Bat

The entrance is placed at top left cell and there's always a bat right there
(be careful, the Alpha bat can be here too).

You should calculate the minimal possible time for the alert to reach the
leader with a precision of two digits (Â±0.01).
