So as not to startle her, since her back was to me, I said, loudly, \"What are the odds of two geocachers parking next to each other?\" \n\nAfter some searching, I spied the cache and gave her a nudge.

ArtieD asked a few weeks back if I'd be able to attend these events and do some caching on this day.  Despite being on call for work I was lucky enough not to have any major night calls the previous night so we met at our usual place and made our way to SLAGA territory.  After the lunch event we decided to go for a challenge cache that ArtieD qualified for but I fall way short on.   But there were some caches on the way.  This was the first one near the posted parking coordinates of the challenge cache.   ArtieD made a quick find of the cache.  This is an interesting little spot in the middle of an outlet mall, it's nice to see this green space in the urban area.   I don't think I've ever seen a pecan tree and the oldest one at this location is HUGE.  TFTC"

The drive around the area was nice, and we enjoyed looking at the scenery. We might have been just our dynamic duo to anyone who might glance our way, but they'd be wrong. The ghosts of geocachers past, present, and future kept us company while we were on our journey.\n\nThe caches that were on our agenda were fun to find, and we appreciate each and every cache owner for placing them.

These two gentlemen claim to have inspired the screenplay and provided very credible evidence which lured this gullible soul to the airport with $45,000 in equipment. When I arrived at LAX, I was greeted by the two men and taken to a warehouse where I lived for sixteen days on cheese and Diet Coke. Long story short, I decided these two compulsive liars were far more interesting than the Matrix. Arnie can't hear and thing, and Randy is... well... Randy. Feeling sorry for them, I agreed to let them fly back with me to the area and work on my farm. Both men needed professional help, and the kind doctor recommended they both get into geocaching. Go figure, right?\u00a0</p>\nVisit http://monstersomething.blogspot.com/ to get started. Solve and you'll find your path to discover the coordinates.

Once again, L Frank has designed a unique ornament that can be converted to a cache container for a future hide; or, you may keep it, your choice. <strong>PLEASE</strong>, if you get an FTF on one of the 12 days, do not go for another one until day 13, let someone else have the fun.</p>\n<p>Again, there will be a Bonus Cache on the 13th day, December 25th. EVERYONE is eligible to find the bonus whether or not you have FTFed a Cachemas hide. This cache can only be found by using all the codes written on the inside of the container lid of each daily cache. Keep these codes and use them to solve the location of the Bonus cache which will publish on the final day, December 25th.

He brought this great series to St. Louis.</p>\n<h2><strong>This Geocache Description:</strong></h2>\n<br />\n<p>I was hiking through the woods one day, when all of a sudden, I heard this banging sound. Startled, I stopped and listened: \"What is that? Where is it coming from?\" I continued walking, \"There it is again. What the heck!\" That loud banging sound. Curious, I started walking toward the sound. Upon reaching the edge of a clearing, I realized these strange noises were on the far side. I crept to the other side to a spot behind a big ole tree with a hole in its side and climbed into the tree for a better view.</p>\n<p>Wow! To my surprise, before my very eyes standing on a stage of fallen timbers was none other than the nasty old Grinch himself. Continuing to pound his gavel on a makeshift podium, he began to speak to a group of Elves gathered around him. I could not believe my eyes, THE Grinch and Elves, \"What was up?\" This couldn't be, could it?</p>\n<p>As I was in the tree deciding if I was sane or not I heard .... Cachemas..... Hold on! What? Now with my full attention I sat listening to the Grinch. He was telling the elves about how he had heard about a holiday game played in SLAGAland called \"The 12 Days of Cachemas!\" Oh boy! He wasn't happy! He was going on about how a person called Major134 was in charge of this game and he was asking the elves for their help in putting a stop to this holiday fun. OH NO!!!! What put an end to our holiday game? I had to find out more so I could warn Major134. I see an elf wander off down the path so I decided to follow him and see what else I could find out. He goes over to a stump off the side of the path and disappeared. I waited a few seconds and wonder closer to the stump. Hmmm! Where did he go? Oh! A secret passage way. Looks scary, so I grab the flashlight from my backpack and head on in. I shined my light around, but don't see the elf. There is just a container of some sort; I give it SHAKE! Sounds like it has marbles in it. Weird! Curious I open the lid and see a bunch of containers. I opened one and inside was a tag with a weird code on it. As I put the container back where I found it, I hear voices approaching. I hurry back down the passage way and out to hide in the middle of some nearby trees.</p>\n<p>After a few minutes, out comes a group of elves. Off down the path they go with me following behind. Suddenly, one of the elves stopped by some downed trees while the others kept walking back to the clearing. I watched as he put more containers in and around the trees. What are the Grinch and the elves up to? Is the future of Cachemas to be ruined? I decided that I had to get some help right away and the ONLY place I could get the kind of help this was gonna need was to go to THE NORTH POLE!!!! If I can get to Rudolph in time he will be able to help. I put the GPS coordinates for the North Pole in and set off for help.</p>\n<p>When I finally make it to the North Pole, it's dark and eerie. Strange! With it so close to Christmas, this place should be like Wal-Mart (open 24 hours). But no. Only a dim light off in the distance. Well, I didn't come all this way for nothing. I need help to save Cachemas. I head towards the light. When I get closer to the glowing I had seen, I realize that it's an <strong>Ultra-Violet light</strong>. Closer, still I see that it's actually Rudolph. Thank goodness! I found help. I ran over to Rudolph and started to explain who I was when he stopped me, \"Nanonabber, I'm so glad you got my signal.\" \"Signal?\" I asked. \"What signal?\" \"Well you saw my nose didn't you?\" he asked me. \"Yes! I did, but I didn't know you sent it as a signal,\" I replied. Rudolph then proceeded to tell me how he had overheard some of the elves talking about a secret meeting with the Grinch. He then told me how he sent a secret message to Major134 to warn him and how he had hidden it on some containers and hidden it on one of the elves going to meet the Grinch. OMG!!!!!! I GOT IT!!!! I YELLED!! Rudolph jumped. Calm down Nanonabber, He said. You startled me. You got what? He asked. I then told him what all I had seen and why I came to the North Pole. All of a sudden we hear this big loud evil laugh.</p>\n<p>BAHHHHHHHHAAHAAHHHAAAA!!!!!!!! Slowly out of the shadows of a building comes the Grinch. He had followed me after the lone elf spotted me at the group of trees and told him I was in the area. He smiled his evil grin and turned to a group of elves that were still in the shadows and said \"Go at once and destroy the containers. \"OH NO!!!!!!!!\" I YELLED \"Please don't do that. Don't ruin our holiday game fun. THAT WOULD BE EVIL OF YOU!!!!! PLEASE PLEASE DON'T RUIN OUR CACHEMAS TRADITION!!!\" He turned to me and said \"I will give you a chance to save you precious game, BUT , you must solve the codes and crack the clues. If you do this and make it to the final, then , and only then, will I leave your holiday game alone.\" I looked at Rudolph and said we gotta get there fast will you help me? Rudolph said \"With my <strong>special light,</strong> I will make it there super fast.\" Now we need your help to save Cachemas:</p>\n<p>There are <strong>3 waypoints.</strong> There WILL BE decoys. ALL the information you need is in the description, plus some clues.</p>\n<p><strong>EVERYTHING YOU NEED AT EACH WAYPOINT WILL GET YOU TO ANOTHER WAYPOINT.</strong> Have fun and hope you enjoy my evil Cachemas. Yours truly, Nanonabber69</p>\n<center>Permission was received to place this cache at this location by the St. Charles County Parks Department.</center>\n\n<p>Additional Waypoints</p>FN7FF4X - Final Location<br />N/S  __ \u00b0 __ . ___ W/E ___ \u00b0 __ . ___ <br />Yep, it's in there.<br />"

Got the coordinates for the second stage without too much problem, but the next stage gave me a bit more trouble. Finally straightened that out it my head and off to the third waypoint. Wasn't sure I was going to be able to access the log, but a mighty stretch and a bit of scrabbling led to successfully adding my name to the log.

Pete and nanonabber are over hiding in the bushes. The Grif, Unut, N0WNV, and BMZdaddy rush over to WP2 while we look for the clues at 1. We get over to WP2 and they are still there. We get the clues and off to the final. When we get there, the Grif has Unut on his shoulders and she is pocketing the FTF prize. Another classic Cachemas find.

Lisabe texting me the whole time lol ok maybe not the whole time are you ready yet finally I text home getting changed be ready by 845ish lol got ready by 830 so text lisabe I'm ready to which she replied already here lol  .... so out i go with all my things I needed for the day and off we go to meet Davo328  at the park.... ok so as we are heading that way lisabe asks me if I had seen the new cache in Wentzville yet and that we should have started there .... to late already heading the other way and running alittle late as is so it was decided  that if not found by the time we were done with out prior commitment that we would try for ftf.... we get done at Creve Coeur park and decided we all had worked up an appetite and head to fortells pizza and ordered lunch .... just finished and sat down when a ding went off on my phone and there was an email for a new cache published and we were within 10 miles of it so we said why not try for it once we are done ... with the weather veing snowing out we may have a shot for the ftf... so we get done and part ways with Davo328 and start for the new cache that so showed no logs .... as we get about 3miles of it I checked logs again and saw paulgracies log but not for ftf hmmmm what to do continue on or head home...  duh do we really need to ask ourselves... off we go anyway and make the find not sure where we finished but close to top 5 I think lol ... I made the find lisabe stamped log ... ok by this time it's really snowing so we head back towards home area and along the way lisabe asks me are still up for going after the new cache in Wentzville that I was telling you about and of course my dumb a@@ said of course and off we go down the highway .... as we get closer I keep checking the log ok so far so good no posts... go a little farther and check again still good ... get off highway at exit and had to make a pit stop....checked again first to make sure no logs ... ok into qt for a quick bathroom stop.... finish up back in the car check again and no logs off we go.... finally get to parking lot and read cache page .... wait a minute we have to do what .... cross the creek oh boy but where to go .... Lisabes down by the side throwing loose rocks into the stream to make a stepping spot across and off we go .... I look and say hey what's that over there I think it's the cache ... I get closer and my footage is going down but nope it's not the cache it's some trash...darn I was so close my gps says ... so I turned around to tell lisabe nope I was wrong it's just trash when outta the corner of my eye I spotted something not quite right and so after closer inspection I instead yelled found it lol .... Lisabe stamped the log and filled in the ftf time of 220pm and yes indeed it's a creek in a very neat spot thanks for placing this cache and for making an awesome end to a fun day geocaching with friends"

We arrived at GZ and decided to give it a good look anyway. After a few minutes of searching, low and behold! The cache was intact and in place- just caked with mud, but the magnet held against the force of water which appears to have been so strong as to overturn the port-a-potty along the trail.  Even more incredible- the log was dry and we were able to sign it!  Very impressive and we are so glad to report that it survived the flood! Oh and BTW- a very nice view of the bridge progress.

We sat in then hospital parking lot and I came up with the answers to the puzzle.     After making our way to GZ, I looked at typical spot, but it was not there.   Hum ... now what.   I expanded my search area and still \"No Joy\".    I went back to my first spot thinking the QR code might be part of the cache, but no, it was a true munzie.   Not knowing what else to do, I called the CO, something I don't like to do on {FTF} quest.   However, she confirmed I was at the correct GZ, but the cache was in her car!!!!   Seems she had picked it up in the AM being uncertain the reviewers would publish it.   She said wait about five minutes and she would be there with the cache.   Sure enough she showed up and handed me the container and I signed a blank lot and took the TB from inside then the CO put the cache safely back where it was supposed to be!

Not familiar with this new trail\u2026 I called the CO to see what I had missed. She directed me to the right parking lot and then fixed the cache page.\n\nWhen I go to the parking\u2026 I pulled out my GPS and entered the coordinates for the caches. Then down the trail I went\u2026 pretty sure I had an FTF or two to claim since the area cachers had been dormant for months\u2026 and the next closest active ones lived 20 minutes further away.\n\nI made my way down the trail and then off into the woods to ground zero. My GPS was a little flakey and had me about 20 feet away looking around before I turned around and saw it back behind me. I gleefully opened the cache and pulled out the log to sign my name on a blank log\u2026 only to find Brink of Discovery had come back from the dead to claim that slot today. Oh well! I still got to see a cool new trail!\n\nThanks for a great hide, Candyce!"

My GPS had me climb straight up to the top of the hill through some very, **very** sharp briars before taking me over near ground zero. But for some reason my GPS unit was being a little flakey and had me 20 feet away in the thick woods. After searching the area thoroughly and finding nothing\u2026 I made my way down a little ways and saw what I was looking for.\n\nI signed the log and then put everything back where I found it. After that\u2026 I explored some more of the trails of the area and saw an incredibly beautiful pond lined with bluffs. Thank you for showing me this great new trail, Candyce!"

I am always looking for a cache super close to home and a chance or 2 or 3 (lol) for a FTF, but I decided to hold off and save them for an open day on my calendar. Today was that day. I told my husband last night I was going to get a cache today. He suggested going earlier than later with the weather forecast being less than desirable. I got up and double checked the local caches anticipating going out for one at the Miller Post Nature Reserve that was just released a few days ago when this little puzzle caught my eye. I didn't see it go out yesterday, but I was at work until 9:45pm, so this morning I looked and nobody had logged it yet. I began to do a little research and after 3 tries (the first was accidental and did I mention puzzles are not my thing), the coordinate checker said I was good to go. After a brief discussion with myself (doesn't everyone do that?) about whether to go for the FTF or try for the new one at Phoenix Park (great park), FTF won and off I went, but not before grabbing my binoculars to do a little birding while I was out there. I had been out here once before when it first opened, so was glad for another reason to check it out again. After a short walk, the cache was in hand and the moment of truth......YES! a clean log book and a FTF travel bug. Thanks Candy!"

After that it was time to head home back to St. James.  Then I dropped the bomb she'll on my muggle husband and told him I wanted to grab just couple of caches because that is what I do. I have found all of the caches in Washington so now I'm working on the Union area. This is the first one of the caches I grabbed.  I knew what I was looking for I thought and after a very short effort I found what I was looking for.  The cache is in great shape, it was high and dry.

Last night I was a little busy taking care of things I needed to do at home and didn't have a chance to get away. But when I had to come to Union tonight for a couple of hours anyway\u2026 I checked and saw that there was still no log on the cache and knew that I had to give it a shot.\n\nI arrived at waypoint 1 and spent a little while reading the Civil War history that was told there\u2026 gathering the specific information that I needed for the cache. That really must have been a scary time in Missouri with the division that there was.\n\nThen I moved on towards waypoint 2\u2026\u00a0and encountered a \"no trespassing\" sign\u2026 so I headed back out onto the road and went around to where I parked in front of the building. I started counting things by light of my flashlight\u2026 and was sure of two of the numbers\u2026 but wondered if my answer for the other one was right. The checksum reassured me that I was on the right track though! So I plugged all my gathered information into the coordinates and headed that way.\n\nFor some reason\u2026 Google Maps wanted to take me halfway to Washington and then turn around and come back. I ignored it and saved myself around 5 miles of driving. I pulled over (mostly) off the road about 85 feet from ground zero and headed in. I wasn't sure of the best route in\u2026 but I managed to get to ground zero and saw the cache as soon as I was at the right angle.\n\nI didn't know if I would be the first here or not\u2026 but it was worth it anyway. But when I popped open the cache and opened the log book\u2026 I found it completely empty! So at 6:37 p.m. I signed my {FTF} on the log and dropped in one of my signature miniature, marbled dice. I also grabbed the prize.\n\nThanks for a fun cache full of history\u2026\u00a0and a nice final location and container, Pastor G!"

But a little moving around brought it into view. Then I headed a couple of blocks away to the bank to read a little about its history. In no time... I had the final coordinates in hand and knew where I needed to go.\n\nI drove over to the area of the cache and parked across the street where it seemed better to leave the car than right near the cache. After walking over to ground zero... I searched a little bit... then waited... searched a little bit... then waited... over and over again... because I seemed to be there right when all the muggles decided to go by. But I finally found it and popped out the log.\n\nI left my name on the log and one of my signature items in the container. Then I waited for traffic.. and stuck everything back where I found it.

He'll be driving soon and I told him not to drive through running water over a road.

This was the closest unfound one to my home\u2026\u00a0and one I had started after a week or two ago before getting stumped. I got a little unnerved last time because there was somebody sitting in the nearby chair by one of the waypoints\u2026\u00a0and there was a large crowd of people on the other side of a huge window on the other side of the waypoint. I think I got so distracted by the people that I just couldn't see the waypoint.\n\nToday I was beginning to wonder if it wasn't more of the same. I found the waypoint I got stuck on last time\u2026\u00a0but immediately got stuck again on the next one. I only halfway interpreted the clues right and was searching about 20 or 30 feet away from where I should have been. And even once I figured out my location was off a bit\u2026 I still couldn't seem to see it. I was getting so frustrated and ready to give up. Then I happened to look in the right direction\u2026\u00a0and **there it was**!\n\nFortunately\u2026 I didn't have so much trouble with the last waypoints. And before long\u2026 I was logging the final. I grabbed a trackable from the cache to move along\u2026 and I left my signature on the log and one of my signature items in the container. Thanks for a fun and unique cache, Pastor G!"

So besides the workers there are 7 to 10 people waiting to go in and no one looked like Geocachers or Pokemon Go players.  I get out of my truck and decide to go ahead and start my search and here comes a lady with a clipboard headed right for me.  Well she wanted signatures to get independent candidates on the ballot in November and I told her no thanks (I was on a mission, what was she thinking) and went on my way. I had my first clue and the doors were open, I found my way around and located the cache without anyone paying attention to me.  I was scared the lady teaching Spanish would notice me and she is a big talker, that would keep me from being able to make the grab. I was able to get around her without her noticing me and make it to the final.  Since no one was there I knew the log would be blank but it is still a nice feeling seeing that blank log.  I left a TB, coupon for a free ice cream to Sonic and a coin.  I thought the cache was so nicely done and great for kids I headed to Sassy1027 house to see if I could grab LilDude317.  Sassy and Finebear have plans for the day because Finebear is leaving to go back home to England today and LilDude was not home.  Wow finding LilDude is harder than finding the cache.  I went on my way and decided to check out my sister\u2019s house and there he was sitting in the living room.  He said sure I will go but will you bring me to your work first I need to have my coin counted so off we went.  He got his money and then on to the library where I let him do the whole thing by himself, he did it way faster than I did. He took his first TB and left, two pieces of swag and checked out a book.  Thanks Pastor G for a well done cache, favorite point from me."

I glanced at it\u2026 knowing most of the recent caches had been down in the city or way over in the St. Charles area. So I wasn't expecting much. But I noticed this one had to do with Union\u2026 and saw the direction and distance\u2026 and knew I needed to get my street clothes back on. I had only been home from a full day in Union for about 30 minutes when the cache published\u2026 but with a possibility of being first on the scene\u2026 I was willing to head back again.\n\nTwenty minutes later I was at the first waypoint and looking around for info in the light rain. I was scribbling the answers to the questions on a paper\u2026 as the rain smeared my ink. But I got all the requested info at waypoint 1. So I hopped back in my car and read a little further about the checksum. It didn't add up. So I grumbled and got back out in the rain and began carefully going over all of my answers again. Every one of them came out the same.\n\nJust as I was considering a third round of checking the info\u2026 scottinmo drove up. So we went through the answers together. We both came up with the same thing. We tried sending a message to the CO\u2026 but there was no answer right away. We decided to go with what we had and head for the second waypoint at the new Post Office.\n\nWe quickly had the answers we needed here too\u2026 but again things weren't adding up for the second checksum. We were a little frustrated\u2026 but hoping the checksums were just wrong\u2026 we punched the calculated coordinates into Google Maps to see where they led \u2013 about 400 feet off the road on private property that didn't look like the sort of place that would allow a cache. We sent another message to the CO and double and triple checked our answers.\n\nA few minutes later while we were scratching our heads\u2026 the CO messaged back and we had him call scottinmo. We talked it out and realized we and the CO had made an error. One of the questions was incomplete\u2026 and so was one of our calculations. With his correction and ours\u2026 we plugged in the coordinates and came up with a **much** more likely cache location.\n\nAlthough it wasn't far to the cache\u2026 scottinmo indicated that he had run out of time and had to head for Washington. I told him he probably had time to claim FTF with me\u2026 but he was being the responsible dad I would have trouble being with an FTF on the line. [:D] So just a few minutes later\u2026 I walked right up to ground zero and found the cache in the first place I looked. And at 10:18 p.m. I signed my {FTF} on the top of the log and dropped in one of my signature item. Thanks for the nighttime fun, Pastor G!"

As the cache owner, you are also responsible for physically checking your cache periodically, and especially when someone reports a problem with the cache (missing, damaged, wet, etc.). You may temporarily disable your cache to let others know not to hunt for it until you have a chance to fix the problem. This feature is to allow you a reasonable time \u2013 normally a few weeks \u2013 in which to arrange a visit to your cache. In the event that a cache is not being properly maintained, or has been temporarily disabled for an extended period of time, we may archive this listing.\"**_\n\n----\n\nIf it is not disabled already,  I will temporarily disable  it, to give you an opportunity to stop by and check on your cache.\n\nIf you haven't had time to check on it by my next check I'll go ahead and archive it then. \n\nIf you decide that this project has reached its end you can archive it now to remove it from the active cache database. \n\nWhen everything is OK again, please remember to enable your cache and post an \"Owner Maintenance\" log on your cache page. This log removes the \"needs maintenance\" and allows your cache to be shown in the search results of Pocket Queries. Don't let your cache be filtered out unnecessarily in Pocket Queries by forgetting to reset the attribute!\n\nMaintenance should be completed very quickly or   your cache will be considered abandoned and will be archived. \n\nI want to thank you for the time that you have taken to contribute to Geocaching in the past and I am looking forward to hopefully seeing your cache up and running in the near future.\n\n##_**HOW TO RESPOND IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS**_##\n\nRespond by posting a new Note. Go to the cache page in question, and click on Log Your Visit. Select \"Post Note\" as the log type, and enter your message. Doing that, I'll know exactly what cache your message pertains to, which will speed the communication process.\n\nIf you're reading this as an email, don't reply to the sending address. It won't reach me.

It is worrisome when a cache with a successful find history has a string of DNF's. The geocaching community would like to know how it's going here. Is your cache still here, is it being worked on, that sort of thing. When you get a chance, please log onto your page and give everyone an update by posting a note to your cache page.\n\nIf it is not disabled already, I will temporarily disable your cache   to give you an opportunity to stop by and check on your cache.\n\nIf you haven't had time to check on it by my next check I'll go ahead and archive it then.\nIf you decide that this project has reached its end you can archive it now to remove it from the active cache database.\n\nWhen everything is OK again, please remember to enable your cache and post an \"Owner Maintenance\" log on your cache page. This log removes the \"needs maintenance\" and allows your cache to be shown in the search results of Pocket Queries. Don't let your cache be filtered out unnecessarily in Pocket Queries by forgetting to reset the attribute!\nI want to thank you for the time that you have taken to contribute to Geocaching in the past and I am looking forward to hopefully seeing your cache up and running in the near future.\n\nHOW TO RESPOND IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS\nRespond by posting a new Note. Go to the cache page in question, and click on Log Your Visit. Select \"Post Note\" as the log type, and enter your message. Doing that, I'll know exactly what cache your message pertains to, which will speed the communication process.\nIf you're reading this as an email, don't reply to the sending address. It won't reach me. Follow the contact instructions above.\n\n\n----\n***Thanks a MILLION, Glenn***\n***\"Seek quality, not quantity\"***\n--Your friendly Missouri Geocache Review team is:\n ***[*gln](http://www.geocaching.com/profile/?u=*gln), [Mongo](http://www.geocaching.com/profile/?u=Mongo) and [Banjo-Boy](http://www.geocaching.com/profile/?u=Banjo-Boy)***\n \n----\n\n\n{#5e968158a933718b2929e97906c863e6}"

Unfortunately\u2026 it came out after dark\u2026\u00a0and we had to work during daylight while the park was open. But come Saturday morning\u2026 nobody had logged a find yet\u2026 so we headed out to Sullivan to Meramec State Park for a little hike in the woods. We didn't program the parking spot in the GPS\u2026 because we've been here a few times before\u2026 and after a little drive found ourselves pulling into this little parking spot.\n\nAfter walking a ways down the trail\u2026 we took the shortcut trail and a few minutes later we were at the point where we needed to head off the trail. Up, up the hill we went and towards ground zero. I saw the cache from about 50 feet away and kept walking towards it. Pastor G came up behind me a few seconds later and saw it too. So we grabbed the container from its hidey hole and pulled out the log. It was **blank**! Woohoo! So at about 11:13 a.m.\u2026 we signed our {FTF} on the log, took a few pictures, and then put everything back where we found it with our signatures on the log and one of my signature item in the container.\n\nOn the way back\u2026 we decided to try something new\u2026 and checked to see where the old \"road\" in the woods actually ran into the **paved** road. It was an easy-going route\u2026 but with the giant mound at the entrance from the road\u2026 it was obvious they didn't want anybody driving down there. The walk along the road was easy (or course)\u2026 but had me worried about traffic since there wasn't much of anywhere to dive off the side except for down tall, steep hills in many areas. Fortunately\u2026\u00a0the walk was only about ten minutes long back to the car.\n\nThank you so much for another excuse to go romping through the woods out here in one of my favorite parks, Candyce!"

Each will have a part of the scenery of Missouri that reminds us of parts of the Trilogy.  In this series you will discover caves, hilltops, streams, valleys, and cliffs while enjoying beautiful Missouri scenery.\nThe container is a small lock n' lock box large enough for TB's and trinkets. \n\u00a0 This cache is in Meramec State Park.  The final location is on the Wilderness Trail in the park.\u00a0 You will pass through stands of pine trees, cedars, and oak, and traverse hillsides and hollows, and cross small streams.\u00a0 Tolkien's LOTR Trilogy often comes to my mind when we am hiking and the coordinates and clues will lead you to a beautiful and unique place.\u00a0 You don't need to know the Trilogy to solve the cache but if you do know it, it adds to the fun!  See the title.  \n\nThe hike can begin at the trail-head for the Wilderness Trail in the park, but I have provided coordinates for parking a little closer to the cache to shorten the hike.\u00a0 \nParking for the shorter loop is along MO 185 Spur which is a  two-lane road and you will need to pull off onto a small parking area.\u00a0 It is not suitable for vehicles with very little clearance and it is possible that it will be full since it accommodates only one car.\u00a0 Summertime can be a crowded time in the Park so it is best in the Fall and Winter.\u00a0 There may be muggles near the cache in the summer.\u00a0 Either starting point will get you to the cache.\u00a0 The full trail is a 10 mile loop, but from the parking coordinates it is a 6 mile loop or a 4 mile out and back.\u00a0 The terrain is mostly flat with a few small hills.\u00a0 The trail is well marked but I recommend picking up a trail map from the Ranger's Station located just inside the Park entrance.\u00a0 Then you can drive back to the parking coordinates or down into the park to the trail-head for the Wilderness Trail if you want to hike the whole 10 mile loop.\nThis link will show you a map if ranger station is not open:\nhttp://www.mostateparks.com/sites/default/files/Meramec.pdf\nThank you to Brian Wilcox, ranger at Meramec State Park, for permission to place this cache.  \nFor those of you unfamiliar with this part of the story, Gandalf The Grey was leading his party and the ring-bearer to Lordor to destroy the One Ring.\u00a0 They were forced to escape across the mountains and a terrible storm unleashed by Sauron made them desperate enough to go through the Mines of Moria, a terrible place of the Dwarves from ancient times.\u00a0 At this point they were faced with a rock wall (The Walls of Moria) with a hidden door and had to solve a riddle to get inside.  \n\nThe cache is not in the cave which is closed and off-limits.\n\n\nAdditional Waypoints\nLP40GG4 - Loop Trail Parking\nN 38\u00b0 13.423 W 091\u00b0 07.116\nSmall parking along road for upper wilderness trail"

The trek out was uphill and excruciating, but we finally completed that part of the adventure too. \n\nThanks for this incredibly challenging cache.

We were determined to find this cache after all the effort it took to get here. So after reading the description better, we reflected back on the movie Lord of the Rings. We crossed the fallen timber stretched across the water rapids and found ourselves at the right spot of the cave wall. Then we searched for a hidden stone \"door\".

You would think that was the end, nope.  We had to walk back out of those woods in the rain, which had picked up significantly, and the growing darkness.  He had remembered to mark the truck before we went in, and I knew how so we marked it.  Turned out to be the best thing we did, because we took the wrong direction and needed to bushwack to get out of there as it was near pitch black at this time and we were getting soaked.

We spent around 15 minutes looking in holes and under outcroppings and dead trees in the area... but nothing was found in any of them. Finally... we gave up and read the hint. Even that only narrowed down the hunt to one specific huge area. So even with the hint... we had to spread out to perform our \"narrowed\" search. With each of us at a different part of the area and working toward the middle... we spent 5 minutes covering ground, checking the many likely spots... when I saw yet another likely spot.\n\nBut this time, it had looked like [b]something[/b] was out of place. I carefully stepped toward the spot... and as I did... saw footprints where I was stepping. Were they from other cachers that had beat us here today... or from the CO? I reached for the something that looked out of place... and then saw what I was so hoping to see and yelled [b]Got it![/b] At 11:18 a.m. we signed our {FTF} on the beautifully, blank log... and I dropped in one of my signature item. Then we took some pictures... put everything back... and continued on down the trail to finish the loop.\n\nIn the end... this side of the trail wasn't quite so beautiful... but made for an easier walk. About a quarter mile from the car... we ran into a couple out for a Thanksgiving hike of their own who encouraged us that we were \"almost there.\" And not long after that... the car was in sight and we were done. About 5.5 miles and 2 hours, 45 minutes of hiking and hunting after leaving the car... we were back to it and on our way home.\n\nToday, Thanksgiving... I am thankful for awesome, beautiful, long hikes in the woods. This is likely the only cache I will get today... but it's the kind of cache I like best. Thanks for a great morning, Candyce54 & Tombombadil-mo!"

          "#text": "(#1,414) Out caching before the day's feasting with Pastor G and PilotHere. We had print outs of the park's trails and Pastor G's GPS had the trails on its maps. Even so... the Meramec Park map had no indicator of what the scale was. So we went in knowing it was probably over a mile to the cache... but I don't think we really knew exactly what we were getting into. After passing the parking area without seeing it... we turned around a third of a mile later and slowly drove back... and [b]there[/b] it was. It wasn't much... but there were a couple of parking spots. PG pulled in and we strapped on our backpacks and prepared to set out. The cache coordinates were entered in the one GPS that didn't have them yet... and off we went - 1.5 miles as the crow flies to the cache.\n\nNot too far into the hike... we ran into our first \"T\" (or more of a \"Y\" here) in the trail and after consulting the GPS and the maps... we decided to take a right. We didn't know for sure... but it [b]looked[/b] like the shorter of the two ways to the cache. It wasn't. [:)]\n\nAfter quite awhile more... we found another \"T\" (which very much [b]was[/b] a T)... and after consulting our guidance devices and sheets... we argued for a few minutes about which way we were supposed to head. Despite the map's guidance... the intersection didn't look like it did on the map... so it threw us off a little. But we made the right choice when we finally headed to the left.\n\nThere was a lot of up and down and back and forth on the trail. We weaved around trees and rocks and creek beds... and even climbed over a large, fallen tree at one point. This wasn't the fastest route to the cache (as mentioned before). There were numerous times when we'd get closer to the cache for awhile... and then the GPS distance reading would start climbing again for a few minutes. But even though this may not have been the fastest route to the cache... it was certainly the most scenic of them... and the view of the Meramec through the trees was great!\n\nFinally... we were about 300 feet from the cache... and the path diverged again... only this split wasn't on the map. I thought the left trail, up the hill, looked new and not part of the main trail... but the arrow [b]was[/b] pointing that way more than the right-hand trail. And so after we argued for a little while... we went up that trail. We climbed the trail to the top of the hill and got closer and closer to the cache. Finally... we were at the point where the GPS read about 20 feet from the cache. And that 20 feet was somewhere out in thin air over a cliff.\n\nWe went a few feet further down the trail and found a place where we could work our way down to the bottom... and did so. Coming down right by the cave... I saw a [b]million[/b] great places to hide a cache... and began hunting. Pastor G and PilotHere pointed out that the description eliminated the need to go into the cave (and good thing they said something too... 'cause the way we came at this... we had missed the \"stay out of the cave\" sign.\n\n[Continued above.]"

I quickly got dressed and ready to go when I gave the geocache another thought.  I thought I could still get there, find it and get to work on time.  Well, there was only one way to find out.  So at 5:00, I jumped in my truck and headed toward Bourbon along the back roads in Franklin and Crawford counties.  \nI parked as close to GZ as I could and checked the cache page again.  No one had logged a \u201cfound it\u201d yet.  To help me make the find quicker, I checked the hint.  I read the hint, looked at where I was and knew exactly where the cache had to be.  I walked right to it and grabbed the container without the use of a flashlight or headlights on my truck.  I was happy to see a blank log sheet in the container.  I added my name, date and time of 5:27 am and claimed the first to find {FTF}.  \n\nNow, could I make it to work by 7:00 am in downtown St. Louis?  Oh, I know the suspense is killing you.  Yes! I made it.  Thank you for another cache Pastor G."

When you get a chance, please stop by and do a little look and TLC. If you choose to remove this cache you can archive it then. \n\nBoring snip from the guidelines...   [CACHE MAINTENANCE](http://www.geocaching.com/about/guidelines.aspx#cachemaintenance) \"... As the cache owner, you are also responsible for physically checking your cache periodically, and especially when someone reports a problem with the cache (missing, damaged, wet, etc.). You may temporarily disable your cache to let others know not to hunt for it until you have a chance to fix the problem. This feature is to allow you a reasonable time \u2013 normally a few weeks \u2013 in which to arrange a visit to your cache. In the event that a cache is not being properly maintained, or has been temporarily disabled for an extended period of time, we may archive the listing.\"   \n\nIf this is going to be down for an extended period of time due to construction it might be best to go ahead and archive. Once all of the construction is completed then a new cache can be placed since the area may be altered.\n\nIf the \u201dNEEDS MAINTENANCE\u201d attribute is showing you will need to do the following. [CACHES THAT NEED MAINTENANCE](http://support.groundspeak.com//index.php?pg=kb.page&id=57)\n\nMaintenance should be completed within the next 30 days or the cache will be considered abandoned and may be archived. \n\nI want to thank you for the time that you have taken to contribute to Geocaching in the past and I am looking forward to seeing your cache up and running in the near future. I will be looking forward to hearing back from you soon. In the meantime your cache has been disabled. \n\nThanks for your understanding,\n\nThanks, \n[*gln](http://www.geocaching.com/profile/?u=*gln),  [Mongo](http://www.geocaching.com/profile/?u=Mongo) and [Banjo-Boy](http://www.geocaching.com/profile/?u=Banjo-Boy)\nYour Missouri Geocache Reviewers\n\n----------\n\n{#3fb7a22bea3f438893785770129fd8fe}"

Clocked in 67 miles sticking mainly to forest roads (and roads that my Garmin BMW Motorrad Navigator V SAID were roads which I soon learned that if there was no number following the \"Forest Road\" that it may or may not be an actual road and just a trail through the forest...good thing I was on my GSA!) A few of those \"roads\" had me siting back on the seat and ducking as the canopy closed in. I did have to give up on one of them and turn around since the trail just disappeared. Not too easy turning around a 600 lb beast in an area as wide as it with soft ground, but I made it happen and got back on a different forest road path. Saw some really cool sights and covered some great ground. Will add a snapshot of my route to my log.\n\nThanks for placing these caches. I am sure going to miss caching in this area. Saw this one still sitting on my horse.\nKris\n\n\nFind number 2798\nFound at 1113 27-Nov-2016\n--Found using Locus Pro / Geocaching4Locus with my Motorola Droid Turbo 2 and GSAK."

       "#text": "<p>Much of the Ozark region is an area of Karst geology where groundwater has dissolved rock to form caves, sinkholes, springs, sinking creeks, seeps, and other features.\u00a0 In large cave systems, collapses are very common. Sometimes in large caves that are near to the surface, the ceiling gets too thin and collapses. Other areas contain rock domes that can withstand the pressure of the overlaying earth. When an area collapses and erosion continues over time, the collapsed rooms are widened to create a small valley with a (former subterranean) river. Kaintuck Hollow is thought to have formed in this manner when a massive system of caverns collapsed long ago.<br />\n<br />\nKaintuck is a misspelling/mispronunciation of \u201cKentucky,\u201d and the area is named after a small town of that name that used to be nearby. A nearby church is named \u201cKentuck,\u201d which is another misspelling. These strange spellings/pronunciations are due to the fact that many Ozarkers lacked a formal education when these areas were settled.<br />\n<br />\nThe remnant feature that is commonly called \u201cKaintuck Natural Bridge\u201d is actually a natural tunnel, defined as a nearly horizontal cave open at both ends, fairly straight and uniform in cross-section. There is a slight bend in the tunnel, so that you can\u2019t see from one entrance to the other. The \u201cKaintuck Natural Bridge\u201d is located directly off one of the loops of the Kaintuck Hollow Trail. A small spring on the upstream end of the tunnel keeps the floor of the tunnel wet in a few places. The tunnel is approximately 175 feet long and has a small cave in one side.</p>\nThis location has a bit of a caching history. The first cache placed here was a traditional cache in early 2004. We adopted it in mid-2007, then archived it after a few months so we could make it an Earthcache (not realizing that Earthcaches and traditional caches can be co-located.) The Earthcache was archived in 2012 in an effort to protect our local bats from the spread of white nose syndrome. Now we've placed a new traditional cache, in what we think is the exact spot where the original hide was located!\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Additional Waypoints</p>P164E1V - Parking<br />N 37\u00b0 51.012 W 091\u00b0 54.900<br /><br />"

We hunt in the area and are familiar with it and approached the GZ from the west.  Right before we were to make the turn onto Kaintuck road (which is the parking for the cache) there was a massive tree on the bridge from the recent flooding!  I wish we had stopped to take a picture.  We took an alternate route going north on P and then catching T to go south.  It was quite late in the day when we set out after this cache and it was starting to get dark.  After driving all the way around though we were not going to give up.  We kept driving and passed the Kentuck church mentioned in the description.  We finally reached the parking waypoint and set off.  A few yards down the trail one of the penguins fell off a rock while crossing the stream soaking their left leg.  It was suggested they go back to the vehicle but they wanted to continue.  We passed what appeared to be 4 sinkholes on the right side of the path.  We continued on down the path and after walking a ways realized that we had passed the cache.  We ended up going up a hill and then down another side of it but still couldn't find the bridge.  Finally we heard the sounds of water and ended up at the natural bridge.  Looking at the bridge I thought it looked a bit smaller then the photos I had seen.  It turns out we were on the side of the tunnel that the cache was not on.  We walked a bit over the hill and then we found the side of the bridge we were suppose to be on.  It was more amazing then the pictures that I have seen.  There was a lot of water inside compared to the other photos I have seen of this bridge.  We signed the log and started back.  When we got up the trail a bit before it turned we looked back and could see the bridge right off the trail maybe 100 feet.  I'm not sure how we walked right by it except that it was a bit dark when we were out. On the way back we stopped off at the Kaintuck cemetery.  This was actually in our GPS as a place of interest so we were able to find it easily in the dark.  We walked around looking at the graves with headlamps.  What we thought would be a quick find turned into quite an adventure and this is what we love about geocaching!  TFTC and you get a favorite point from us!"

Although this one hadn't been placed that long ago, the history of it was old.\n\nDrove to this area from the 4 caches over at Rock n'View/Nature's Theater area. Found the access road and the parking area with no problem. Parked and smiled at the creek to cross just beyond the trailhead sign. Reminded me of labyrinth with the bog of eternal stench and the rocks, sans the eternal stench LOL. Managed to cross the creek and keep my feet dry.\n\nOnward down the Oak Leaf Trail I went, enjoying the beauty of the area. Spots were a bit slushy as can be expected after the recent rains. \n\nGot to the Natural Tunnel and was impressed by the size of this feature and that it turns in the middle. Didn't see any bats, but could tell someone had been in there since there was a small pile of sticks not far from the entrance.\n\nSnapped a few photos, found the cache, and walked around to the other side to see the whole thing. Really cool tunnel that I am glad I decided to come see. Definitely would be a good earth cache.\n\nLooked at my map and decided, oh what the hell, and took off further down the trail to go after the Mill Creek caches. The trails all connected nicely just like my map overlay I made from the info found at  https://fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fsm8_045344.pdf depicted. \n\nThanks for placing this cache, and for the Mill Creek ones that I found next. Got my exercise in for the day :)\n\nKris\n\nN 37\u00b0 50.942 W 091\u00b0 54.749 (Access Road)\nN 37\u00b0 51.009 W 091\u00b0 54.884 (Parking Area)\nN 37\u00b0 50.806 W 091\u00b0 55.126 (Trail Junction)\n\n\n# 2436\n12:45 23-Dec-2015 \n--Found using Locus Pro / Geocaching4Locus with my Motorola Droid Turbo 2."

Specter saw it come out when it was published, and called and asked if I'd like to join him in a quest to find it.  Well, I've joined him in two quests to seek the holy grail, so how could I refuse?  \n\nOur first attempt to arrive at this cache was thwarted by Grotto Road being closed.  Don't go that way.  It is not going to be reopened anytime soon, if ever.  So, after rerouting through Newburg (an interesting trip in itself), we headed out Highway P, and soon were on a county road heading toward the cache.  We found a parking place, and set out on the trail and made the short hike to the tunnel.  After a not so brief search, Specter discovered something that didn't look quite right, and had the cache in hand.  We signed the log, and then decided to explore the tunnel.  I'm sure glad we did, as we made some interesting finds inside.  Lots of cave crickets make this place their home, as does a large wolf spider.  We also spotted a cave salamander, and some bats.  I got the surprise of my life when I shined a light into a crevice, and had two eyes staring back at me--some kind of a cave rat!  \n\nSpecter and I were discussing this hide during the trip.  There are so many geocaching hides that take us, and have taken us, to places we probably would have never know even existed if not for geocaching.  This was one of them.  Thank you for placing this cache, RicknJoy!  It was, in addition to being our quest, the best place we went today."

Clocked in 67 miles sticking mainly to forest roads (and roads that my Garmin BMW Motorrad Navigator V SAID were roads which I soon learned that if there was no number following the \"Forest Road\" that it may or may not be an actual road and just a trail through the forest...good thing I was on my GSA!) A few of those \"roads\" had me siting back on the seat and ducking as the canopy closed in. I did have to give up on one of them and turn around since the trail just disappeared. Not too easy turning around a 600 lb beast in an area as wide as it with soft ground, but I made it happen and got back on a different forest road path. Saw some really cool sights and covered some great ground. Will add a snapshot of my route to my log.\n\nThanks for placing these caches. I am sure going to miss caching in this area.\n\nKris\n\n\nFind number 2797\nFound at 1040 27-Nov-2016\n--Found using Locus Pro / Geocaching4Locus with my Motorola Droid Turbo 2 and GSAK."

Burress</b></center>\n<br />\n<br />\n<center>Beside the dolomite/sandstone cliffs which rise above the\nBig Piney river, there is a huge dolomite/sandstone boulder which\nfell and resides in the bend (meander) of the River. Historically,\nthis boulder often was the cause of major log jams as local\nlumberjacks attempted to float their logs down the Big Piney to\nnearby mills. No matter what they did, the boulder always seemed to\nwin\u2026\u2026..LOG JAM! Over the years and a whole lot of\ncussing later, this area became known as the \"Elbow of the\nDevil\". After a short period of time the name the <b>Devil's\nElbow</b> stuck.</center>\n<br />\n<br />\n<center><img src=\n\"http://img.geocaching.com/cache/d553a860-1c9c-4155-8b7b-5258e011ca94.jpg\" /></center>\n<br />\n<br />\n<center><b>The Cliffs Above the Elbow</b></center>\n<br />\n<br />\n<center>\"The view of the tall bluffs of Gasconade dolomite visible\nfrom the bridge was once described as being one of the \"seven\nscenic wonders of Missouri\" in literature from the Missouri\nPlanning Commission. The town of <b>Devil's Elbow</b> is considered\nto be one of the highlights of a tour on Missouri Route 66. The\narea is home to the Big Piney River and the scenic <b>Devil's\nElbow</b> bluffs, Sheldon's Market which doubles as the\n<b>Devils Elbow</b> Post Office, The Elbow Inn Bar And Grill which\noriginally opened in 1929, and last but not least, an old steel\ntruss bridge across the river.\" It is from this bridge that you\nview the EarthCache. Parking is just before arriving at the bridge\n(see coordinates). The bridge is seldom used and is wide enough but\nwatch for stray vehicles.</center>\n<br />\n<br />\n<center><img src=\n\"http://img.geocaching.com/cache/333f0477-3772-4274-b931-56b305cc0c30.jpg\" /></center>\n<br />\n<br />\n<center><b>The Bridge</b></center>\n<br />\n<br />\n<center><b><font color=\"green\">A brief description of the\narea's geology</font></b></center>\n<br />\n<br />\n<center>The <b>Devil's Elbow</b> of the Big Piney is a\nmeander that was preserved when the Ozarks Mountains were uplifted\nand the river was rejuvenated. Prior to the uplift, the Mountains\nhad been eroded down to a flat plain, which is common to old\nerosional settings. As with the Mississippi and other ancient\nrivers, the river had slowed and was curving across a wide\nfloodplain. When the region was once again uplifted, the river was\ndowncut from its existing position, thus preserving the meandering\ncourse. Such entrenched meanders or curves are common to rivers\nthroughout the Ozarks.</center>\n<br />\n<br />\n<center>The oldest geological formation that outcrops is the\nCanadian Series Ordovician-age Gasconade dolomite. The dolomite\nunderlies the Big Piney River as well as being exposed as the bluff\nalong the River. The pre-erosion thickness of the Gasconade\ndolomite is thought to be between 200 and 300 feet. The Roubidoux\nformation overlies the Gasconade dolomite. It varies from dolomite\nto cherty dolomite to sandy dolomite to sandstone. The contact of\nthe Roubidoux and Gasconade Formations is present at the top of the\nbluffs overlooking <b>Devil's Elbow</b>. Due to the resistance of\nthe Roubidoux formation, several small overhanging ledges of\nRoubidoux sandstone are present along the bluffs at <b>Devil's\nElbow</b> and others along the Big Piney. One rock protrusion of\nsandstone above <b>Devil's Elbow</b> is called the \"Devil's Tongue\"\nby older generations and \"Lizard Rock\" by those who are younger.\nThere are other names, which refer to certain other body parts of\nthe devil, but discretion prevents printing them on this\npage.</center>\n<br />\n<br />\n<center><img src=\n\"http://img.geocaching.com/cache/d174e39d-9ea2-4dca-8096-b0230b7cd1ab.jpg\" /><br />\n\n<br />\n<center><b>The Devil's What??</b></center>\n<br />\n<br />\n<center><b>NOTE:</b> In order for you to claim a find on this\nEarthCache you must complete the following: <b>1</b>.

This find also extends my consecutive day find streak to three hundred three (303) days, nine (9) months long plus.  Wow!

This\nroad if opened all the way through would connect with the road that\ngoes by Hooker Church and if you study the terrain you will see it\nwound it's way around the base of a large hill. When the 4 lane was\nput through it bypassed this section by cutting through the hill\nand forming what was known as Hooker Cut. <br>\n<br>\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\n\"http://img.geocaching.com/cache/74c875da-61bd-45a8-98c3-c8b2463729fc.jpg\">\n</p>\n<br>\n<br>\nThe above photo shows the stretch of Old 66 and the photo below\nshows a scenic view next to the cache showing present day I44 and a\nbluff overlooking the Big Piney River <br>\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\n\"http://img.geocaching.com/cache/aa5f1832-5674-4c76-b2c8-303de88ee107.jpg\">\n</p>\n<br>\nThe cache is a magnetic key holder with a log sheet.

Now, somehow the word had gotten out that I was a\ngeocacher.  (Could it have been the geocaching excursions\nduring my TDY trips?  The occasional absences from the office\nwhen new caches were published nearby?  The big sign in my\ncubicle that read:  \"I'd Rather Be CACHING!\"?)  For\nwhatever reason, the word was out. </font></b></p>\n<p><b><font face=\"Comic Sans MS\">So at my retirement luncheon,\nwhile some people get gold watches, or medals, I got a geocache! -\nand not just a geocache, but a GEO CACHE!  It's a 30mm ammo\nbox, and came stocked with really nice swag, including toys,\nflashlights, key chains, insect repellent, spare batteries,\nmagnets, hats, etc.  I promised that I would place it\nsomewhere in the vicinity of Fort Leonard Wood, where I worked for\nmost of my Army civilian career. </font></b></p>\n<p><img src=\n\"http://img.geocaching.com/cache/07f14ae9-1a58-4697-99f2-462de7600cfa.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><b><font face=\"Comic Sans MS\">So, FINALLY, here it is!  It\ntook me awhile to find a good place for it.  I was denied\npermission for my first choice of location, but then I discovered\nthis conservation area called the Fort Leonard Wood Tower\nsite.  It's just behind the old fire tower.  (The cache\nis placed under a Special Use Permit from the Missouri Department\nof Conservation.) By the way, the tower itself is a benchmark (PID\nHD1028).  When I logged it, I quickly calculated that I had\ndriven past it approximately 12,700 times on my way to and from\nwork.

All of the stages of this Multi-Cache are virtual in nature, requiring you to gather information from each location to determine the coordinates for the final. The final is a physical cache with a log that you must find to complete the cache and log that coveted \"smiley.\" The final location is located outside of the boundaries of Fort Leonard Wood on public property.</strong></h2>\n<h2>\u00a0</h2>\n<h3>To begin this adventure you must gain access to Fort Leonard Wood. <u><strong>Please visit the stages of this Multi-Cache during daylight hours only!</strong></u> The posted coordinates are for the sign at the Welcome Center located at the North Gate. There is no reason to visit this location. Since you will be entering Fort Leonard Wood, there are some basic rules that you must comply with to gain entry. If asked at the gate by the guard why you wish to enter the base, simply tell them that you wish to visit the museum, static displays, and memorial parks. Fort Leonard Wood has a high number of civilian visitors due to this being an initial entry and advanced individual training base which conducts class graduations almost daily. Be advised that admission procedures may change or be restricted based on\u00a0Force Protection Condition\u00a0(FPCON) security levels due to potential threats. If the base were to change the FPCON levels to prevent non-DoD personnel from accessing the installation, this cache will be disabled until access is again granted to civilian personnel. While on the installation please practice safe driving and do not use your phone (or GPS) while driving. Determine where you are heading to next and set it prior to putting your vehicle in gear!

Let's get to the adventure!</strong></h1>\n<br />\n<p>Proceede to STAGE1 at Memorial Park - Chemical - Engineer - Military Police and Veterans</p>\n<ul>\n<li>While at this park enjoy the beauty and remember the Veterans who have served to support and defend this great nation. You will notice an area with several flagpoles and memorial stones. When you are standing at the monument that reads \"Veterans Memorial Park\" and facing the flags, look to the first memorial stone on the left. On one side of it there are two rows of text. Look at the second word on the first row. Underneath it there is a four digit year which is on the second row. Take the second digit of this date (or third) and use it for letter <strong>F</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You may now either enjoy a short walk to the next stage, or relocate your vehicle to the parking area STAGE2 at Equipment Park</p>\n<ul>\n<li>As you look around at all the equipment in the vicinity of this park, find the Caterpillar Crawler Tractor which is set up to tow a grader {South of 19th St. in the field north of the old Barracks bldgs across the street from the Equipment Park waypoint} Look at the informational signage at this tractor and find out what the designation of this 1951 Bull Dozer is. The designation is two characters long. Use the number in the designation and use it for letter\u00a0<strong>B</strong>.</li>\n<li>Walk back across the street near the Equipment Park waypoint and look around the displays for the M67A1 Flame Throwing Tank. On the rear of the tank are the words \"US ARMY\" underneath which are some more characters. Use the first number in the second row beneath \"US ARMY\" for letter <strong>I</strong>.</li>\n<li>Before we leave these displays, find the Huey <em>{UH-1B Iroquois}.\u00a0</em>Look at the tail number and use the second to last digit for letter <strong>J</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At this time, once you finish enjoying the static displays, return to your vehicle and move to STAGE3 Joint Services Park</p>\n<ul>\n<li>At this tribute park which has a static display to represent each of the five military branches, find the display representing the Coast Guard. On this display look for the registry number which is located on the bow and the stern. This number consists of five digits. One of those digits is used twice in the registry number. Use this digit for letter <strong>A</strong>.</li>\n<li>While you are here and enjoying this little park, find the Navy display. At this display is an informational sign which mentions the weight in \"lbs. per link\" for the item. Use the last digit in this weight for letter <strong>C</strong>.</li>\n<li>Now move over to an amazing piece of equipment representing the Air Force. On this display there is a large 3 digit registry number on both the nose and tail. Use the first digit in this number for letter <strong>D</strong>.</li>\n<li>And finally before we leave this beautiful little park, look for the plaque upon which is written \"Joint Services Park\" beneath a large stone sphere. At the bottom of the plaque is a date. Use the first digit in the date for letter <strong>H</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now it is time to move on. Make your way back towards the north gate of the base. Prior to getting to the gate you will see some static displays on the right hand side. Be sure to slow down so you don't miss the entry to the parking area STAGE4 for these displays or else you will go back out the gate and have to reenter the installation!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Once you get parked at this small display area, find the interesting Armored Vehicle Launcher Bridge {would be hard to miss this one!} What is the military designation for this piece of equipment per the informational signage? Use the third character of this designation for letter <strong>E</strong>.</li>\n<li>Last one! Move over to the M93A1 FOX Nuclear-Biological-Chemical Reconnaissance Vehicle. On the rear of this vehicle you will find two interesting pieces of equipment for a wheeled vehicle to have (would be more used to seeing them on vessels.) Above the left device on the rear is a unit designation. The numbers in this designation (all 4 of them) when added together should be used for letter <strong>G</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Congratulations! You should have now obtained all the required information to ascertain the location of the final!</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Final Coordinates: N 37\u00b0 AB.CDE \u00a0W 92\u00b0 FG.HIJ</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Check sum of ABCDE=32, FGHIJ=25</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Go ahead and load those final coordinates into your device and take a short ride off the installation to the physical container! Do not park on Missouri Ave (the main road leading into Fort Leonard Wood) to locate the final. There is plenty of parking on the street running parallel to Missouri Ave which does not have a high volume of traffic.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Use care if you are caching with small children that they do not wander onto Missouri Ave at the final! Please sign the log and place the cache back exactly as you found it.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>I hope that you enjoyed this Multi-Cache on Fort Leonard Wood. This is a great community installation to visit that has many great events and activities that are open to the general public. If you have not already found them, there are two physical Traditional caches located on the installation! {They were placed prior to the current rules about physical caches on military installations are are grandfathered according to the rules) They both involve a short hike with significant elevation change to reach them and caches like them are the reason why I got involved in this hobby/sport in the first place. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</strong><a href=\"http://coord.info/GC44A\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"line-height:1.6;\">Teacher's cache</a>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<a href=\"http://coord.info/GCCF89\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"line-height:1.6;\">overlook cache</a><br />\n<br /></p>\n<h2>Thanks again for participating in this adventure!<br />\nSee you on the trails,<br />\nKris<br />\n<br /></h2>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>Don't forget to visit the Museum when you get a chance!</em></p>\n<em><a href=\"http://www.wood.army.mil/ccmuseum/default.htm\" target=\"_blank\">JOHN B.

We were very impressed by the Memorial Park.  It was in its early formative stages last time we were out this way, and it has really turned out nice! We've been to the museum before, but it seems like it just keeps getting better and better!  A friend of ours is a former Curator - he may have had something to do with it!  I remember the construction of the Joint Services Park, and watching them bring in the A-10 slingloaded under a Chinook helicopter - as they lowered it, it started to oscillate, so they brought it down FAST - now that was exciting!  I was gratified to finally see an ASV at the AVLB display area - it's one of the last systems I was involved with before I retired!  \nWe had a bit of a problem with the digit for letter I, but we were able to figure out the solution using the checksum, then headed off post to locate the final.  (Thanks for getting it replaced so quickly!)\nThis was an enjoyable and well-designed multi that showed off a few highlights of Fort Leonard Wood, the premier training base in the Army, and a nice little stroll down memory lane for the two of us!\nTFTC!\nRicknJoy\nMaries county, MO"

BYOP.</p>\n<p>Congratulations to GeopenguinsH on the FTF!</p>\n<p>Read below to learn a little history about Frog Rock. <em>(Excerpt from <u>http://www.waynesvilledailyguide.com/article/20120919/NEWS/120918584/-1/News</u>)</em></p>\n<p>The true story of Frog Rock, also known as W.H. Croaker, actually starts with a humble man with a tattooed face, long gray hair, a passion for arts, and a love for the town he calls home. \u00a0Phil Nelson of Waynesville is a man who has spent most of his life making his mark on people. He is an artist. For over 33 years, as medic in the Army, Phil has traveled the world permanently marking people with his artwork as a tattoo artist. And in 1983, he settled into the town of Waynesville, where his mother was at the time. \u00a0\"I lived all over Europe, South America, and the Caribbean,\" Nelson said. \"And all my friends say 'why Missouri?' and I tell them this is the closest thing to Mayberry as it gets.\" \u00a0Nelson, who calls himself \"just an old hippie,\" likes the vibe of small-town Missouri. People are friendly. They stop and wave when they don't know you. The little things made him call this place his home. \u00a0And in 1996, it was well-known around town that Nelson was not only an artist, he was also talented with sculpting. \u00a0So one day, Sheila Debo of Waynesville came to Nelson asking him to sculpt the ugly rock formation into something worthy of Waynesville Hill. \u00a0\"I thought it would make for the perfect tiger head to go with the Waynesville mascot, but the people in the city had something else in mind.\" Nelson said. \"They wanted a frog. Someone on city council or something liked frogs. And that was it, I was to sculpt a frog.\" \u00a0And for the next nine months, Nelson spent his mornings from roughly 6:30 to 9:30 a.m. sculpting. He sculpted through the granite in all sorts of weather \u2014 through snowy mornings and through blistering heat\u2014 all free of charge. \u00a0He even fell off the rock, three times.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>"

So we hopped off the highway and made our way down to park just downhill of ground zero.

We began looking around\u2026 and after a few minutes\u2026\u00a0Forest-Ghost came up with the find. I took nothing from the container\u2026 and left only my signature.

I saw some interesting new sights in Missouri and also added a new county to my map! We seemed plagued with more than our typical share of DNFs, but that didn\u2019t stop the day from being a fun one. Thanks to all of the COs who placed the caches we found today. \n\nInitially, I did not have this cache on the route, but when we went in search of a diner (which we never did find) we passed by and spotted the frog on the hill. \"Hmm, I wonder if there is a cache there,\" I thought to myself. Sure enough! November Ghost charged up the hill. I had shoes without much tread, but I got up there. We had fun taking pictures and looking around. While signing the cache log, a passerby yelled something rather crass at us from his vehicle. You kinda are on full display up there... Thanks for the fun cache!"

The Talbot House has 8 bedrooms, kitchen, large formal dining room, family room, and four bathrooms. The house is current with central heat and air.<br />\n<br />\nTalbot House was named after Dr. Charles Talbot who practiced medicine in the home for over 30 years. After Dr. Talbot\u2019s death his widow turned the house into a boarding house for telephone operators, teachers, and law officers. Many elderly have returned to see the room they once lived in and have shared their stories.<br />\n<br />\nBonnie Dubowski purchased the house from Mrs. Talbot and lived there for over 30 years. Bonnie was an avid antique collector and had many antiques. Those who knew her say it was beautifully decorated with antiques. Upon Bonnie\u2019s death the house was sold. The house began to slowly deteriorate. Many of the original lights and fixtures remain in the house today.<br /></center>\n<br />\n<br />\n<center><a href=\"http://s17.photobucket.com/user/usarmympwife/media/bed60eeb-a8d4-4019-8fff-c4bb276caeba_zps68f9b2a1.jpg.html\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://i17.photobucket.com/albums/b68/usarmympwife/bed60eeb-a8d4-4019-8fff-c4bb276caeba_zps68f9b2a1.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\" photo bed60eeb-a8d4-4019-8fff-c4bb276caeba_zps68f9b2a1.jpg\" /></a></center>"

We found several great hides today and the rain only interrupted us once. The fun day found us back home at 6:30 pm with 17 caches found a no DNF's.\n\nWe appreciate your efforts in placing this cache for our geocaching enjoyment.
