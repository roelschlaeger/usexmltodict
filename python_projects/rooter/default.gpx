The reserve has a beautiful wildflower garden, several lakes, 100 acres of prairie, oak-hickory and evergreen forests and a gravel bar along the Meramec River. There are 14 miles of trails. The area is open from dawn to dusk each day except Christmas. Members are free.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The reserve has a beautiful wildflower garden, several lakes, 100 acres of prairie, oak-hickory and evergreen forests and a gravel bar along the Meramec River. There are 14 miles of trails. The area is open from dawn to dusk each day except Christmas. Members are free.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Caching with the Rooter to get out and stretch our legs.  This was a fun one.  We loved all of the waypoints.  Good job.  Thanks, Candyce54 and Walkingstic-stl, for placing this cache.  Mean Gene and the Rooter

to me 
I'm sorry.  We've been adjusting the page and I think it got lost.
I can give you the final - if you want since it's my fault.
H is the same as B &amp; G
J is the same as C &amp; E

Page down if you want the final.....

If we own the story then we can write the ending$~I found the three waypoints without a problem, but when I went to compute the final coordinates, I couldn't find information for the "H" and "J" values used in the final....

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">(#824) Out caching my Saturday afternoon away with Pastor G at Shaw Nature Reserve. This was the fifth of 10 finds for me today. We stopped at the visitor's center when we first arrived today... but then once the other waypoints were entered in the GPS... decided we'd just take care of them as we got closer... due to our route while finding other caches on the way. Once we got in the general area of some of the waypoints... we visited and took note of the requisite data.

Fortunately... the last point we actually got to was the Bus Stop - a good place to sit and rest and do some calculating. And so I made the calculations from all of the data that had been gathered and came up with some coordinates. The coordinates looked a bit off... especially one particular digit that was repeated in a few places. And upon putting them in the GPS... it said the final was 6.5 miles away! Then I [b]knew[/b] that digit was wrong.

From the possible coordinates that would still be within Shaw... I knew what the digit had to be... though I'm still not sure how I was supposed to arrive at that answer from the data I had gathered (I musta missed something). So I changed the digit in all of the places where it had landed. [b]That[/b] was a lot closer... and made a lot more sense. When we got to GZ... we both went opposite ways around it... getting there about the same time... and I happened to be just slightly ahead and saw it first. Took nothing... left my signature.

We had nine left &amp; got them all with the L Franks. We also revisited a couple of the early Shaw ones. We hiked a little over five miles on a perfect caching day.

Sarah had photos of the needed info from last week out here, but we didn't use the info then to find the cache. Last night we got the coordinates and came here on our way back to the cars. This is a great multicache, thank you Candyce54 &amp; Walkingstic-stl for this and all of your other great caches here at Shaw. Please place some more, we don't have any left to do here!

As noted in other logs, I had already visited the Serpentine Wall and Cemetery before arriving at the bus stop.  The required information was discovered, and work commenced on deciphering the final location.  Pressure to continue on to other caches was always on the back of my mind as the time for sunset seemed to be rapidly approached; nevertheless, I persevered and had the final coordinates soon in hand.  What?!  It's where?!?!  I sighed deeply and made my way to the indicated location a bit frustrated that I could have made this trip a bit less extensive.  Finding the container only took a couple of moments but gave pause as it seemed to be precariously clinging to its hiding place.  Signing commenced, and the cache was replaced as discovered with a little trepidation.  Okay, one multi down!  What's next?  It looked like an interesting spot out in the wetlands . . .

Set out with the idea I was going to 'clean out' the Shaw caches I hadn't found yet - fell a bit short and only got 14 of the 19 I needed.  Had a great time doing it though on a nice day.  Checked a TB tag through.  TNLNSL TFTC</groundspeak:text>

Wasn't sure we could do this one as the road was closed.  But no problemo.  Beautiful day in the neighborhood.  I always find these pocket cemeteries to be interesting.  The serpentine wall would be a good replacement for those sheets of steel (sculpture?) in downtown STL.  And that bus stop would be a life saver in a storm.  TFTC</groundspeak:text>

The weather forecast threatened ice and rain, but the skies held and we had a great day of caching.  Started the day by grabbing a cache right outside of the park, then proceeded to clear out every cache in the park with the exception of one DNF.  After leaving the park we stopped and ate a late lunch, which recharged our batteries enough that we grabbed four more caches in the Eureka area before heading home.  TFTC!

This was a well done cache and I enjoyed it.  I had a nice time figuring it out and seeing some new places.  Thanks for a well done cache.  I was confused at first on the checksum, but soon figured out I needed to add them again.  Anyway, that number could only have been one number.  

I got off at the Gray Summit exit about 11 am.  I was rather shocked when I saw a wreck by the Gray Summit exit on the national news.  I did not see anything.  I guess it was by the other Gray Summit exit.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">WARNING:  The cache and parking waypoints are at the exact same cordinates.  Since a GPS can only draw one thing at a particular point, either the cache or the parking waypoint will be covered up.  On my OR 550T, the parking waypoint covered up the cache.  So when I looked at the map I did not realize there was a cache under the parking waypoint.  I figured the parking waypoint was for one of the other caches in Shaw.  So I ended up not doing this cache.  Looks like a nice cache and wish I had done it.   But I will be back soon to do it.  I only figured out there was another cache here by looking at the area on my GPS after I reloaded my PQ and saw there were still waypoints in the reserve.  The cache owner will not delete the parking waypoint or move it or the cache so they are not at the exact same place.  So I would suggest deleting the parking waypoint yourself before attempting the cache.  The parking waypoint and cache are both at the 5 minute parking you use to pay your entrance fee.  So there is no need for the parking waypoint.  Just go to the cache.

3 of 3 finds today and 3 FTFs, I have been coming to SNR for a few year and and knew about the bus stop and serpentine wall and knew the cemetery was there but never visited the cemetery until today. Thanks for the history lesson on the Roberts family. After finding all the info needed for the final, it was another quick find with the coords right on.
Traded TBs but the TB I took was not listed as being in the cache and ID number on the TB has not been activated.

The reserve has a beautiful wildflower garden, several lakes, 100 acres of prairie, oak-hickory and evergreen forests and a gravel bar along the Meramec River. There are 14 miles of trails. The area is open from dawn to dusk each day except Christmas. Members are free.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">The cache is a preform container hidden in the woods a short distance from a trail. If the outer road is closed, it can be quite a hike to get to the cache.
The staff prides their selves on maintaining a well-groomed nature reserve. Since it is a lot of work they have some rules that must be followed to keep this area open to us for caching.
1) Sorry but NO PETS

2) No fires or smoking are allowed

3) Bikes are permitted but only on the service roads. Bikes are not allowed on the trails

4) No hunting, fishing or swimming

The only way to enter the property is through the front gate (entering any other way is considered trespassing); there is a $5.00 admission charge for adults, senior citizens (65 and over), $3.00, children twelve and under are free. Members of Missouri Botanical Garden or Shaw Nature Reserve are free. Grounds are open 7:00 am to one-half hour past sunset. The visitor center is open 8:00 am to 4:30 pm weekdays and 9:00 am to 5:00 pm weekends.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Came out here a second day to continue clearing out the nature preserve. Weather was a lot cooler, minus the rain storm that cut my caching hike short. The storm was heading my way and making me nervous so I started heading back to the parking lot at the Wolf Run trailhead. Thanks for the cache, it's been nice hiking these trails. My last cache for the day, the thunder was closer and the skies were dark, since I lost my trail map earlier, I found a sign post map and was able to determine I needed to head to the bus shelter and take cover.

[b][purple]Crowesfeat30[/b][/purple] &amp; I are here at Shaw Nature Reserve for a fun day of hiking and caching. We walked 10 miles, found 23 caches and 7 morel mushrooms and saw a bunch of friends. We had a great time here.

We joined up with TWolpert, How-D, Missouri Highlander &amp; Highlander’s Lassie to seek out as many caches as we could. We signed our group as C.P.6 for brevity. 


We met up with Susie of Quailman2 here and she joined up with us for a while. This was an easy find for us since she still had it in her hands. Thanks cdbrockhound,

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Out caching at Shaw Nature preserve today as part of a SLAGA event.  I'd worked on some of the caches out here last year to make sure I found the Trememdous cache series but didn't get them all.  Today, I think I found most of the rest in the area.  It tooks two different swings but I made a serious dent in what was left and ended up walking about 10 miles or so.  I cached with some old friends and made some new friends in what was a perfect caching day.  It was too bad that we were all spread out because I really didn't get a chance to visit with anyone much.  Thanks to all the cache hiders, John and Laurie and Candy for making this a perfect day.  This was one of the many finds I made today.

This afternoon started getting warm, and the walk was starting to take it's toll but we found this one on our treck to clean out most of Shaw. 

This was # 13 of the 23 caches I found today.  Thanks cdbrockhound for placing this cache. I really do appreciate it.

The staff prides their selves on maintaining a well-groomed nature reserve. Since it is a lot of work they have some rules that must be followed to keep this area open to us for caching.
1) Sorry but NO PETS

2) No fires or smoking are allowed

3) Bikes are permitted but only on the service roads. Bikes are not allowed on the trails

4) No hunting, fishing or swimming

The only way to enter the property is through the front gate (entering any other way is considered trespassing); there is a $5.00 admission charge for adults, senior citizens (65 and over), $3.00, children twelve and under are free. Members of Missouri Botanical Garden or Shaw Nature Reserve are free. Grounds are open 7:00 am to one-half hour past sunset. The visitor center is open 8:00 am to 4:30 pm weekdays and 9:00 am to 5:00 pm weekends.

By this time, the water jar in my bag was getting alarmingly low as the sun continued to pull sweat from my brow.  I pressed on undaunted and hoping to find as many caches as possible in the Shaw Nature Preserve.  This one was not terribly elusive but did require a bit of poking before the container was revealed.  It would not be until a shortcut was taken later in this trip that the cave would be stumbled upon.  Very cool indeed!  If only it was large enough to take refuge from the terrible heat.  [:P]

[b][purple]Crowesfeat30[/b][/purple] &amp; I are here at Shaw Nature Reserve for a fun day of hiking and caching. We walked 10 miles, found 23 caches and 7 morel mushrooms and saw a bunch of friends. We had a great time here.

We joined up with TWolpert, How-D, Missouri Highlander, Highlander’s Lassie &amp; Susie of Quailman2 to seek out as many caches as we could. We signed our group as C.P.7 for brevity. 

This is really a nice place, How-D and Quailman2 were checking out the cave while the rest of us found the cache. Thanks cdbrockhound for the cache, a good hide.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Out caching at Shaw Nature preserve today as part of a SLAGA event.  I'd worked on some of the caches out here last year to make sure I found the Trememdous cache series but didn't get them all.  Today, I think I found most of the rest in the area.  It tooks two different swings but I made a serious dent in what was left and ended up walking about 10 miles or so.  I cached with some old friends and made some new friends in what was a perfect caching day.  It was too bad that we were all spread out because I really didn't get a chance to visit with anyone much.  Thanks to all the cache hiders, John and Laurie and Candy for making this a perfect day.  This was one of the many finds I made today.

Interesting, and not much of a hideout.  There is a much larger one just up the road a bit.

This was # 21 of the 23 caches I found today.  Thanks cdbrockhound for placing this cache. I really do appreciate it.

There was a decision to be made:  should I do the sensible thing and head back to the car to refresh my supplies or continue and look for more geocaches while hiking in an area that did not allow vehicular traffic?  Given the time of day and the number of caches left, I decided to ask my body to take another for the team and press on.  The geocache was quick to find, sign and replace.

[b][purple]Crowesfeat30[/b][/purple] &amp; I are here at Shaw Nature Reserve for a fun day of hiking and caching. We walked 10 miles, found 23 caches and 7 morel mushrooms and saw a bunch of friends. We had a great time here.

We joined up with TWolpert, How-D, Missouri Highlander, Highlander’s Lassie &amp; Susie of Quailman2 to seek out as many caches as we could. We signed our group as C.P.7 for brevity. 

We continued on to this cache from Rock Wall, what a neat area with lots of wildflowers along the way. Thanks cdbrockhound,

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Out caching at Shaw Nature preserve today as part of a SLAGA event.  I'd worked on some of the caches out here last year to make sure I found the Trememdous cache series but didn't get them all.  Today, I think I found most of the rest in the area.  It tooks two different swings but I made a serious dent in what was left and ended up walking about 10 miles or so.  I cached with some old friends and made some new friends in what was a perfect caching day.  It was too bad that we were all spread out because I really didn't get a chance to visit with anyone much.  Thanks to all the cache hiders, John and Laurie and Candy for making this a perfect day.  This was one of the many finds I made today.

Good hide.  I like how you managed to take advantage of what was available to make this hide.


This was # 14 of the 23 caches I found today.  Thanks cdbrockhound for placing this cache. I really do appreciate it.

[b][purple]Crowesfeat30[/b][/purple] &amp; I are here at Shaw Nature Reserve for a fun day of hiking and caching. We walked 10 miles, found 23 caches and 7 morel mushrooms and saw a bunch of friends. We had a great time here.

We joined up with TWolpert, How-D, Missouri Highlander, Highlander’s Lassie &amp; Susie of Quailman2 to seek out as many caches as we could. We signed our group as C.P.7 for brevity. 

We are almost back to the big field below, just this one cache and we are done on this side of the reserve. Thanks cdbrockhound,

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Out caching at Shaw Nature preserve today as part of a SLAGA event.  I'd worked on some of the caches out here last year to make sure I found the Trememdous cache series but didn't get them all.  Today, I think I found most of the rest in the area.  It tooks two different swings but I made a serious dent in what was left and ended up walking about 10 miles or so.  I cached with some old friends and made some new friends in what was a perfect caching day.  It was too bad that we were all spread out because I really didn't get a chance to visit with anyone much.  Thanks to all the cache hiders, John and Laurie and Candy for making this a perfect day.  This was one of the many finds I made today.

Long walk out to this point and we still have further to go to get to the last ones out here.  We are keeping on keeping on.


This was # 15 of the 23 caches I found today.  Thanks cdbrockhound for placing this cache. I really do appreciate it.

   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">The cache is a small lock-lock container hidden in the woods a short distance from a trail. If the outer road is closed, it can be quite a hike to get to the cache.
The staff prides their selves on maintaining a well-groomed nature reserve. Since it is a lot of work they have some rules that must be followed to keep this area open to us for caching.
1) Sorry but NO PETS

2) No fires or smoking are allowed

3) Bikes are permitted but only on the service roads. Bikes are not allowed on the trails

4) No hunting, fishing or swimming

The only way to enter the property is through the front gate (entering any other way is considered trespassing); there is a $5.00 admission charge for adults, senior citizens (65 and over), $3.00, children twelve and under are free. Members of Missouri Botanical Garden or Shaw Nature Reserve are free. Grounds are open 7:00 am to one-half hour past sunset. The visitor center is open 8:00 am to 4:30 pm weekdays and 9:00 am to 5:00 pm weekends.
Thanks to Lydia Toth for allowing these caches to be placed</groundspeak:long_description>

Wowsers!  The namesake for this cache was evident as I approached the area.  With the deft skills of a geocacher with many miles under his shoes, I orbited the tree but once careful of the slope before making the find.  The log was signed quickly as the container was replaced.   I set sights on the next blip on the GPS wondering how long it would take to complete this portion of the trek.

We joined up with TWolpert, How-D, Missouri Highlander, Highlander’s Lassie &amp; Susie of Quailman2 to seek out as many caches as we could. We signed our group as C.P.7 for brevity.
 
We took the long way around to this one and enjoyed the big field and the short climb to the tree. Thanks cdbrockhound,

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Out caching at Shaw Nature preserve today as part of a SLAGA event.  I'd worked on some of the caches out here last year to make sure I found the Trememdous cache series but didn't get them all.  Today, I think I found most of the rest in the area.  It tooks two different swings but I made a serious dent in what was left and ended up walking about 10 miles or so.  I cached with some old friends and made some new friends in what was a perfect caching day.  It was too bad that we were all spread out because I really didn't get a chance to visit with anyone much.  Thanks to all the cache hiders, John and Laurie and Candy for making this a perfect day.  This was one of the many finds I made today.

What can I say, the descriiption fits the hide well.


This was # 16 of the 23 caches I found today.  Thanks cdbrockhound for placing this cache. I really do appreciate it.

   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">The cache is a small lock-lock container hidden in the woods along a small rock wall a short distance from a trail. If the outer road is closed, it can be quite a hike to get to the cache.
The staff prides their selves on maintaining a well-groomed nature reserve. Since it is a lot of work they have some rules that must be followed to keep this area open to us for caching.
1) Sorry but NO PETS

2) No fires or smoking are allowed

3) Bikes are permitted but only on the service roads. Bikes are not allowed on the trails

4) No hunting, fishing or swimming

The only way to enter the property is through the front gate (entering any other way is considered trespassing); there is a $5.00 admission charge for adults, senior citizens (65 and over), $3.00, children twelve and under are free. Members of Missouri Botanical Garden or Shaw Nature Reserve are free. Grounds are open 7:00 am to one-half hour past sunset. The visitor center is open 8:00 am to 4:30 pm weekdays and 9:00 am to 5:00 pm weekends.
Thanks to Lydia Toth for allowing these caches to be placed</groundspeak:long_description>

Trudging uphill, I slowly made my way to the coordinates for this cache.  Whew!  I was definitely starting to feel the effects of the heat and long hike.  I vowed this would be the last find before heading straight back to the car where a nice, large jug of water waited.  [:D]  The container was exposed and quick to find; so, after signing the log, it was replaced with a bit more geocover.

According to the trail map, the path ahead would wind around back to an earlier cache and eventually the road.  This would add at least one quarter of a mile to the trek back.  Needless to say, this wasn't acceptable as supplies were very low.  So, finding a decent place to escape, I dove into the woods with thankfully low brush.  Quarry Road was spotted immediately and made the return trip much easier.</groundspeak:text>

[b][purple]Crowesfeat30[/b][/purple] &amp; I are here at Shaw Nature Reserve for a fun day of hiking and caching. We walked 10 miles, found 23 caches and 7 morel mushrooms and saw a bunch of friends. We had a great time here.

We joined up with TWolpert, How-D, Missouri Highlander, Highlander’s Lassie &amp; Susie of Quailman2 to seek out as many caches as we could. We signed our group as C.P.7 for brevity. 

We came here from Big Tree and found some morels along the trail. The cache was an easy find too. Thanks cdbrockhound,

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Out caching at Shaw Nature preserve today as part of a SLAGA event.  I'd worked on some of the caches out here last year to make sure I found the Trememdous cache series but didn't get them all.  Today, I think I found most of the rest in the area.  It tooks two different swings but I made a serious dent in what was left and ended up walking about 10 miles or so.  I cached with some old friends and made some new friends in what was a perfect caching day.  It was too bad that we were all spread out because I really didn't get a chance to visit with anyone much.  Thanks to all the cache hiders, John and Laurie and Candy for making this a perfect day.  This was one of the many finds I made today.

Good use of the available hiding material. Cache was out of site but only took a couple of minutes to find.


This was # 17 of the 23 caches I found today.  Thanks cdbrockhound for placing this cache. I really do appreciate it.

Finding the geocache was not the difficult part; oh no.  The literal cloud of mosquitoes that had taken a liking to the area proved most challenging.  It would seem that the eighty plus degree weather had brought them out in droves.  I did my best to be rapid when working with the geocache so as to not inhale any more of the little buggers.  Summer sure was getting its last hurrah!

[b][purple]Crowesfeat30[/b][/purple] &amp; I are here at Shaw Nature Reserve for a fun day of hiking and caching. We walked 10 miles, found 23 caches and 7 morel mushrooms and saw a bunch of friends. We had a great time here.

We joined up with TWolpert, How-D, Missouri Highlander, Highlander’s Lassie &amp; Susie of Quailman2 to seek out as many caches as we could. We signed our group as C.P.7 for brevity. 

Sarah found this one for the group, I was really looking in all the wrong spots. I took new readings for this one too, but they match your new coords. This is a very pretty area down here today. Thanks Candyce54,

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Out caching at Shaw Nature preserve today as part of a SLAGA event.  I'd worked on some of the caches out here last year to make sure I found the Trememdous cache series but didn't get them all.  Today, I think I found most of the rest in the area.  It tooks two different swings but I made a serious dent in what was left and ended up walking about 10 miles or so.  I cached with some old friends and made some new friends in what was a perfect caching day.  It was too bad that we were all spread out because I really didn't get a chance to visit with anyone much.  Thanks to all the cache hiders, John and Laurie and Candy for making this a perfect day.  This was one of the many finds I made today.

Armed with the knowledge that the coordinates were off, we managed to find this one without too much trouble.

This was # 20 of the 23 caches I found today.  Thanks Candyce54 for placing this cache. I really do appreciate it.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">(#589) Out caching at the "Shaw Me the Cache" event today. At this point I was hanging out with Pastor G and TeaParty15 and Roverschmidt and cdbrockhound. We all attacked everything within 40 feet of GZ and searched high and low for every possible hiding spot. The cache owner was finally called and pointed us 90 feet away from the GZ reading we were getting... and that's exactly where we found it. I took a 200-ping average of the find location and only came up .001 off from what was just posted... so I think the new coordinates are good to go! Took nothing. Left a die.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Found with puglet1 on a nice spring day.  Unfortunately the loop road was closed but we decided to go for it anyway.  This was the fourth of seven.  No need to bushwack too much in this park as there are so many primary and secondary trails.  I note that the geocaching map is not very accurate so I relied on the park map a lot, especially for the roads and trails that are available.  And I always remember that cache hiders are no dummies and that they take the path of least resistance when making their hides.  The trick is pursuing the hides in the proper order.

I had to make sure I wasn't seeing things.  While walking up the trail, a car was spotted trying to make its way down.  Sure enough, the vehicle was real, and I left the trail to give it room.  Weren't areas like this barred from traffic?  In any case, the cache was quick to find and sign.  The same car approached again as I replaced the geocache returning from whence it came.  One would think that walking the trail would be preferable if enjoying nature were the goal!</groundspeak:text>

[b][purple]Crowesfeat30[/b][/purple] &amp; I are here at Shaw Nature Reserve for a fun day of hiking and caching. We walked 10 miles, found 23 caches and 7 morel mushrooms and saw a bunch of friends. We had a great time here.

We joined up with TWolpert, How-D, Missouri Highlander, Highlander’s Lassie &amp; Susie of Quailman2 to seek out as many caches as we could. We signed our group as C.P.7 for brevity. 

Our plan on how to get the caches in this part of the reserve was getting out of whack with the trails. We got this one and then went down and around to get to Big Tree. I'm not sorry we did it this way, it was a nice walk. This was another quick grab for Sarah. Thanks Candyce54,

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Out caching at Shaw Nature preserve today as part of a SLAGA event.  I'd worked on some of the caches out here last year to make sure I found the Trememdous cache series but didn't get them all.  Today, I think I found most of the rest in the area.  It tooks two different swings but I made a serious dent in what was left and ended up walking about 10 miles or so.  I cached with some old friends and made some new friends in what was a perfect caching day.  It was too bad that we were all spread out because I really didn't get a chance to visit with anyone much.  Thanks to all the cache hiders, John and Laurie and Candy for making this a perfect day.  This was one of the many finds I made today.

While finding the cache, we had a chance to chat with one of the people that was charged with removing all the wild flowers from the area.  They have their work cut out for them.

This was # 18 of the 23 caches I found today.  Thanks Candyce54 for placing this cache. I really do appreciate it.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">(#589) Out caching at the "Shaw Me the Cache" event today. At this point I was hanging out with Pastor G and TeaParty15. We bushwhacked our way cross country to this one... and then across the ditch. Once we got there... the cache was already in hand by another cacher. So we just piggy-backed on and signed the log. Took nothing. Left a die. Thanks for another one, Candy!</groundspeak:text>

   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Shaw Nature Reserve is a 2500 acre reserve featuring tall grass prairie, wetlands, oak/hickory woods and river bottom. It is part of the Missouri Botanical Garden. It is open year round, dusk to dawn. Admission is free to MoBot members, $3 for seniors, $5 for adults and free to children under 12. The paved loop road is open dusk to dawn year round. the gravel loop road is open April through November, weekdays.
Permission  and information obtained from Lydia Toth. 

The final container is now in place (3/31/12).  Open carefully

 The trail to this cache can be via the River Trail or the Barn Road.
There used to be an old barn on that site (hence the name Barn Road) and it was used for a variety of programs.  During the Depression there was a “youth at risk” program that operated out of there…kids came out and spent the night(s) and used the outhouse.  Later on, Edgar Anderson used to bring botany students out from Washington University and they stayed in the barn as they conducted their botanical studies.  I’m not sure when the barn came down but the outhouse still remains.


Thanks to LFrank for great container.  Large enough for lots of goodies.</groundspeak:long_description>

The best way to reach this cache was via a trail loop I had already started on.  Sure, it took a little longer but was quite scenic!  Impressively tall sycamore trees welcomed any visiting the shores of the Meramec River.  A brief time was spent observing the river before pressing on to this geocache.  Upon arrival, a well-deserved chuckle was had as I began searching the area for the intended goal.  It took but a few minutes to locate the container and sign the log.  Very well done!  With everything back in place, I headed back to the trail to seek further hidden treasure.

[b][purple]Crowesfeat30[/b][/purple] &amp; I are here at Shaw Nature Reserve for a fun day of hiking and caching. We walked 10 miles, found 23 caches and 7 morel mushrooms and saw a bunch of friends. We had a great time here.

We joined up with TWolpert, How-D, Missouri Highlander, Highlander’s Lassie &amp; Susie of Quailman2 to seek out as many caches as we could. We signed our group as C.P.7 for brevity. 

Sarah &amp; I did not sign this at Cracker Barrel, we hiked all the way out to get this one. We signed the log and graffiti'd the walls. Thanks Candyce54,

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Out caching at Shaw Nature preserve today as part of a SLAGA event.  I'd worked on some of the caches out here last year to make sure I found the Trememdous cache series but didn't get them all.  Today, I think I found most of the rest in the area.  It tooks two different swings but I made a serious dent in what was left and ended up walking about 10 miles or so.  I cached with some old friends and made some new friends in what was a perfect caching day.  It was too bad that we were all spread out because I really didn't get a chance to visit with anyone much.  Thanks to all the cache hiders, John and Laurie and Candy for making this a perfect day.  This was one of the many finds I made today.

What's that doing here?  Makes you wonder where the house was that went along with this structure.


This was # 19 of the 23 caches I found today.  Thanks Candyce54 for placing this cache. I really do appreciate it.

We loved the container!  And we couldn't help but admire the outhouse graffiti.  [;)]
We thought about all trying to crowd into the outhouse for a picture.  But then we saw the deteriorated condition of the floor and had second thoughts.  This is probably for the best since there were a bunch of wasps building a nest inside.  Getting seven people inside would probably have made the wasps upset and resulted in a painful reminder of this cache.  As it is we all left with a smile.  [:)]

No prying or excessive pulling is needed. Just a simple twist.</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Shaw Nature Reserve is a 2500 acre reserve featuring tall grass prairie, wetlands, oak/hickory woods and river bottom.  It is part of the Missouri Botanical Garden.  It is open year round, dusk to dawn.  Admission is free to MoBot members, $3 for seniors, $5 for adults and free to children under 12.  The paved loop road is open dusk to dawn year round.  the gravel loop road is open April through November, weekdays.

The prairie is an ecosystem dominated by grasses and wildflowers with few trees or shrubs. Prairie once covered the central 1/3 of North America from western Ohio to Texas to the Rockies. The eastern band of the prairie was the tallgrass or bluestem prairie. Prairie plants, with roots penetrating deep into the soil, are adapted to the midsummer droughts of this region. The Reserve's prairie plantings (on former farmland or pasture) represent this once-vast, nearly treeless ecosystem, of which less than 1% of the original remains intact. 

The cache container is large enough for TB's and other items.  Thanks to LFrank for the container.

   <groundspeak:short_description html="False">Cache is located in the Shaw Nature Reserve tall grass prairie.  Depending on your starting point the hike will take you through woods and prairie over a well marked trail system.

No prying or excessive pulling is needed. Just a simple twist.</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Shaw Nature Reserve is a 2500 acre reserve featuring tall grass prairie, wetlands, oak/hickory woods and river bottom.  It is part of the Missouri Botanical Garden.  It is open year round, dusk to dawn.  Admission is free to MoBot members, $3 for seniors, $5 for adults and free to children under 12.  The paved loop road is open dusk to dawn year round.  the gravel loop road is open April through November, weekdays.

The prairie is an ecosystem dominated by grasses and wildflowers with few trees or shrubs. Prairie once covered the central 1/3 of North America from western Ohio to Texas to the Rockies. The eastern band of the prairie was the tallgrass or bluestem prairie. Prairie plants, with roots penetrating deep into the soil, are adapted to the midsummer droughts of this region. The Reserve's prairie plantings (on former farmland or pasture) represent this once-vast, nearly treeless ecosystem, of which less than 1% of the original remains intact. 

The cache container is large enough for TB's and other items.  Thanks to LFrank for the container.

This was a great location, because we needed a little rest after a long day hike.  The viewing platform had a great view, and due to the recent burn, things looked different from normal.  

Found on another Great day at Shaw Nature Reserve.  We love this place.

We had previously found all the near caches.  This was the second of seven.  I notice that there has been a lot of controlled burning in the park, even today.  Every time I get to this observation deck, I think that this would be a great place for a wine and cheese party.  Nice hide.  TFTC</groundspeak:text>

Emptying the last of the water from my jar, it was apparent that a return to the car needed to commence immediately.  The trail ahead, unfortunately, went directly through open prairie up a hill.  Clouds mercifully blocked the sun during my ascent from time to time and allowed a moment to wipe the sweat from my brow.  Whew!  Reaching the top, a gentleman was seen on a nearby bench enjoying the view.  He didn't pay much mind until I got around to opening the cache container.  Zounds, was it loud!  Quick work was made of the log as rudimentary stealth was attempted despite being found out.  All was replaced as intended.  Very inventive and cool!  It made the difficult walk very much worth it.  [:D]

It should be noted that the cache itself is starting to loose purchase from its hiding spot.  I did what I could with the tools on hand to repair the container.

Fortunately... there was this wonderful cache at the top. Once we got to GZ... we looked a minute or so before I glanced over and saw what I knew was the cache. I reached for the only opener that I could see... and laughed my tail off when it opened! Very nice! I picked up a travel bug to move along... and left my signature and my signature item.

[b][purple]Crowesfeat30[/b][/purple] &amp; I are here at Shaw Nature Reserve for a fun day of hiking and caching. We walked 10 miles, found 23 caches and 7 morel mushrooms and saw a bunch of friends. We had a great time here.

We joined up with TWolpert, How-D, Missouri Highlander, Highlander’s Lassie &amp; Susie of Quailman2 to seek out as many caches as we could. We signed our group as C.P.7 for brevity. 

I watched some others open this as I walked up. Cute, and a great idea. Thanks Candyce54 and L Frank for the fun.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Out caching at Shaw Nature preserve today as part of a SLAGA event.  I'd worked on some of the caches out here last year to make sure I found the Trememdous cache series but didn't get them all.  Today, I think I found most of the rest in the area.  It tooks two different swings but I made a serious dent in what was left and ended up walking about 10 miles or so.  I cached with some old friends and made some new friends in what was a perfect caching day.  It was too bad that we were all spread out because I really didn't get a chance to visit with anyone much.  Thanks to all the cache hiders, John and Laurie and Candy for making this a perfect day.  This was one of the many finds I made today.

First one to find after our lunch break and a fairly easy find after climbing the hill.  

This was # 12 of the 23 caches I found today.  Thanks Candyce54 for placing this cache. I really do appreciate it.

The reserve has a beautiful wildflower garden, several lakes, 100 acres of prairie, oak-hickory and evergreen forests and a gravel bar along the Meramec River. There are 14 miles of trails. The area is open from dawn to dusk each day except Christmas. Members are free.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

PAW PAW TREE

A brief introduction:
The paw paw (Asimina triloba), sometimes spelled paw-paw or papaw, probably derives its name from the Spanish papaya, perhaps because of the superficial similarity of their fruit.

A little bit more about the tree:
Paw paws are shrubs or small trees, reaching heights of 2 to 12 meters tall. The northern, cold-tolerant common paw paw (Asimina triloba) is deciduous, while the southern species are often evergreen. The leaves are around 20 to 35 centimeters long and 10 to 15 centimeters broad. 
This slow-growing, small tree; grows in shade along moist ravines and valleys; extract from this tree has been used experimentally in cancer therapy and has been rated 300 times as potent as taxol, the other, better-known plant extract.

Fun Fact!
The paw paw has many names including prairie banana, Indiana (Hoosier) banana, West Virginia banana, Kansas banana, Kentucky banana, Michigan banana, Missouri banana, the poor man’s banana, Ozark banana, and Banango.

Instructions for finding this cache:
On the back of the TREEmendous #25 sign is a number, to that number add 583 to obtain the correct N coordinates - N 38° 28.XXX'. Again, take that same number on the sign and add 495 to obtain the correct W coordinates - W 090° 49.XXX'. The final is a small container with room only for the log book and a pencil.

The paw paw (Asimina triloba), sometimes spelled paw-paw or papaw, probably derives its name from the Spanish papaya, perhaps because of the superficial similarity of their fruit.

A little bit more about the tree:
Paw paws are shrubs or small trees, reaching heights of 2 to 12 meters tall. The northern, cold-tolerant common paw paw (Asimina triloba) is deciduous, while the southern species are often evergreen. The leaves are around 20 to 35 centimeters long and 10 to 15 centimeters broad. 
This slow-growing, small tree; grows in shade along moist ravines and valleys; extract from this tree has been used experimentally in cancer therapy and has been rated 300 times as potent as taxol, the other, better-known plant extract.

Fun Fact!
The paw paw has many names including prairie banana, Indiana (Hoosier) banana, West Virginia banana, Kansas banana, Kentucky banana, Michigan banana, Missouri banana, the poor man’s banana, Ozark banana, and Banango.

Instructions for finding this cache:
On the back of the TREEmendous #25 sign is a number, to that number add 583 to obtain the correct N coordinates - N 38° 28.XXX'. Again, take that same number on the sign and add 495 to obtain the correct W coordinates - W 090° 49.XXX'. The final is a small container with room only for the log book and a pencil.

Greetings,

I am once again checking all the caches in the area to see if any progress has been made on repairs.

I know that schedules can be hectic and time short but I do hope that you find the time to repair this cache.
[b]
If not repaired, this one is scheduled to be archived next month on my next check of disabled caches.
[/b] 

If you plan on having this up and running by next check then you can skip over this notice. 


From the guidelines...       http://www.geocaching.com/about/guidelines.aspx#maint      "... You may temporarily disable your cache to let others know not to hunt for it until you have a chance to fix the problem.  This feature is to allow you a reasonable time,[b]  normally a few weeks , [/b] in which to arrange a visit to your cache. In the event that a cache is not being properly maintained, or has been temporarily disabled for an extended period of time, we may archive or transfer the listing."  

Thanks for your understanding.

When you have made all repairs, please  remember to post an "Owner Maintenance" log on your cache page. This log restores the cache to its fully-functional state and allows your cache to be shown in the search results of Pocket Queries. Don't let your cache be filtered out unnecessarily in Pocket Queries by forgetting to re-set the attribute!


[B][green]Most problems can be solved with good communication so reply back to the reviewer and we will do everything possible within the guidelines to get your cache published. It is best to give me as much information as possible instead of saying nothing at all. This will speed up the process and we can get your cache published. [/green][/b]

If you plan on repairing this cache, please [b]log a note to the cache[/b] (not email) within the next 30 days so I don't archive the listing for non-communication.

Greetings cache owner,

I hate to pop in here like this but from reading the last several logs on this cache it appears that this cache is in need of repair. When you get a chance, please stop by and do a little fixing up. If you choose to remove this cache you can archive it then. 

From the guidelines...       http://www.geocaching.com/about/guidelines.aspx#maint      "... As the cache owner, you are also responsible for physically checking your cache periodically, and especially when someone reports a problem with the cache (missing, damaged, wet, etc.). You may temporarily disable your cache to let others know not to hunt for it until you have a chance to fix the problem. This feature is to allow you a reasonable time – normally a few weeks – in which to arrange a visit to your cache. In the event that a cache is not being properly maintained, or has been temporarily disabled for an extended period of time, we may archive the listing."   

If this is going to be down for an extended period of time due to construction it might be best to go ahead and archive. Once all of the construction is completed then a new cache can be placed since the area may be altered.

If the [red][b]”NEEDS MAINTENANCE”[/b][/red] attribute is showing you will need to do the following. http://tinyurl.com/y8n7vuy

Maintenance should be completed within the next 30 days or the cache will be considered abandoned and will be archived. 

I want to thank you for the time that you have taken to contribute to Geocaching in the past and I am looking forward to seeing your cache up and running in the near future.

Thanks for your understanding,

Many thanks, Mongo

After paying admission, a slow drive was enjoyed to the nearest parking area from this cache's coordinates.  It was an incredibly beautiful day and promised to provide some really nice hiking.  Reading up on the previous logs helped out and gave a much needed bit of information for locating the final.  The walk was short and the geocache easy to find.

I've not been to Shaw Nature Reserve since bringing children here on school field trips.  My recollection of "Shaw's Arboretum" was tall grass, shepherding students through the woods observing nature, moving to the pond to observe that habitat, eating brown bag lunches at the picnic tables, and getting back on the school bus for the bumpy return trip.  Well, it's NOT that way.  I thoroughly enjoyed the beautiful gardens, system of paths and roads, and the tranquil trails through the woods.  Since the original sign for the tree was missing, Ladybug STL was kind enough to supply the missing information for the event today.  TFTC</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">had attempted this second during Shaw Me the Cache Event, only to discover Treemendous signs are gone.  As we were leaving the shelter after lunch, I met Ladybug STL (nice to meet you!) and got the number that had been on the sign.  After discovering my math error which my kids do every so often on their hw, I made the grab quickly for our last find of the day.

Trying to grab all the TreeMendous series before it goes into nevernever land and especially trying to enjoy the fantastic fall weater.  It's hard to believe that in my almost 60 years of life, I've never been out the the Shaw Nature Preserve. I really missed something special.  What a fantastic place.  We spent the afternoon here and did a lot of walking since the outerloop is not open to traffic Friday, Saturday or Sunday.  That meant that we really took advantage of the existing walking trails.  All in all it was a good day and this was cache number 2 of 13 I found today.  Did the math, walked in the garden and then took the walk out to grab the cache.  I really love the area.

I parked in the wrong place so my walk to the first waypoint was longer than it should have been, but I needed the exercise, so that was good! Found the paw paw, did the calculations and then found the cache. Thanks for the hide!</groundspeak:text>

Number 25 in a series of notable trees spanning the greater St. Louis bi-state region, celebrating the United Nations International Year of Forests in 2011. This cache has been placed with the permission of the Shaw Nature Preserve.</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Shaw Nature Reserve is open year round from 7 am until sunset. Visitor Center hours are 8 am to 4:30 pm on weekdays and 9 to 5 on weekends. The Bascom House is open to the public from 10 am to 4 pm Monday through Sunday. The Nature Reserve is open to hikers every day, but the Visitor Center and Bascom House are closed on some major holidays. There is an admission fee.

Please remain on paths where possible.

PAW PAW TREE

A brief introduction:
The paw paw (Asimina triloba), sometimes spelled paw-paw or papaw, probably derives its name from the Spanish papaya, perhaps because of the superficial similarity of their fruit.

A little bit more about the tree:
Paw paws are shrubs or small trees, reaching heights of 2 to 12 meters tall. The northern, cold-tolerant common paw paw (Asimina triloba) is deciduous, while the southern species are often evergreen. The leaves are around 20 to 35 centimeters long and 10 to 15 centimeters broad. 
This slow-growing, small tree; grows in shade along moist ravines and valleys; extract from this tree has been used experimentally in cancer therapy and has been rated 300 times as potent as taxol, the other, better-known plant extract.

Fun Fact!
The paw paw has many names including prairie banana, Indiana (Hoosier) banana, West Virginia banana, Kansas banana, Kentucky banana, Michigan banana, Missouri banana, the poor man’s banana, Ozark banana, and Banango.

Instructions for finding this cache:
On the back of the TREEmendous #25 sign is a number, to that number add 583 to obtain the correct N coordinates - N 38° 28.XXX'. Again, take that same number on the sign and add 495 to obtain the correct W coordinates - W 090° 49.XXX'. The final is a small container with room only for the log book and a pencil.

The staff prides their selves on maintaining a well-groomed nature reserve. Since it is a lot of work they have some rules that must be followed to keep this area open to us for caching.

1) Sorry but NO PETS

2) No fires or smoking are allowed

3) Bikes are permitted but only on the service roads. Bikes are not allowed on the trails

4) No hunting, fishing or swimming

The only way to enter the property is through the front gate (entering any other way is considered trespassing); there is a $5.00 admission charge for adults, senior citizens (65 and over), $3.00, children twelve and under are free. Members of Missouri Botanical Garden or Shaw Nature Reserve are free. Grounds are open 7:00 am to one-half hour past sunset. The visitor center is open 8:00 am to 4:30 pm weekdays and 9:00 am to 5:00 pm weekends.

We didn't find out about the cache event until the day of so we thought we would come out the day after and look for caches that we knew would be there.  Shaw is so beautiful, well worth the five bucks.  Can't wait until we come back.

[b][purple]Crowesfeat30[/b][/purple] &amp; I are here at Shaw Nature Reserve for a fun day of hiking and caching. We walked 10 miles, found 23 caches and 7 morel mushrooms and saw a bunch of friends. We had a great time here. 

This was our first find of the day, very nice walk in the cool morning. We had a bit of a search, Sarah found it in a place I had looked. Thanks cdbrockhound, it was nice to meet you today.

I've not been to Shaw Nature Reserve since bringing children here on school field trips.  My recollection of "Shaw's Arboretum" was tall grass, shepherding students through the woods observing nature, moving to the pond to observe that habitat, eating brown bag lunches at the picnic tables, and getting back on the school bus for the bumpy return trip.  Well, it's NOT that way.  I thoroughly enjoyed the beautiful gardens, system of paths and roads, and the tranquil trails through the woods.  TFTC</groundspeak:text>

Perhaps it was folly to go after this cache.  After all, it was dark and I had less than half an hour to book it back to the parking lot and eventually the car.  The call of the cache pervaded, though, as I came within a short distance of this hide.  Pulling out a flashlight, I silently cursed myself for not letting this go and hopped into the wood.  The find was thankfully quick after checking the likely spots, and a signature was secured in the logbook.  With the container back in place, I dashed back to the road and my bicycle.  Little time remained, and I needed to get to the entrance before the park closed for the night!</groundspeak:text>

Trying to grab all the TreeMendous series before it goes into nevernever land and especially trying to enjoy the fantastic fall weater.  It's hard to believe that in my almost 60 years of life, I've never been out the the Shaw Nature Preserve. I really missed something special.  What a fantastic place.  We spent the afternoon here and did a lot of walking since the outerloop is not open to traffic Friday, Saturday or Sunday.  That meant that we really took advantage of the existing walking trails.  All in all it was a good day and this was cache number 3 of 13 I found today.  This was a nice walk down the trail and the cache was found without trouble.  It is in good shape.

The original church building on 4th and Market Street is now the home of the Washington Historical Society.  In 1993, the congregation moved to this more modern facility.  The traditional stain-glass window facing Highway 100 was part of the previous church building.

This cache is actually a fairly quick park and grab.  Not impossible by wheelchair but assistance might be necessary.  Original items included a 2-cent travel bug, child's ring, whistle, and log sheet.  Bring your own pen or pencil.</groundspeak:long_description>

Park in the church parking lot then hike 25 to 50 feet to the coordinates.  Look for a camouflaged PVC 1.5" diameter by 8" long on the ground under a holly tree north of the building.

He wasn't to excited he just wanted to get back home, have supper and go to bed since he need to get up at 4 am. I said there is an easy one close to where your son works lets grab that one.  We pull up and spot GZ both of us saying yep that is it. My husband turns the car off jumps out and starts running to GZ and grabs it before I even get close....so much for him not wanting to grab one tonight [;)].

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Great day of solo caching that started @ 6am and by the time 10am was here I had 13 caches found and met Pastor G and his friends who are new to Geocaching. Congrats to him on his 300th find today, Enochs Knob Old Scary Bridge, a cache which I helped place with friends 87preludea20a3 and toadfrommars. The new caches in town are a real treat and represent the town well. Most were placed in the last couple months and they made for an awesome morning of finds. 
Last cache of the morning. Good hide, materials used may not withstand the test of time and weather elements but it was in good shape when I found it today. Thanks Pastor G! Nice meeting you and your friends today!!!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">(#760) After getting home from church and seeing 4 caches in Washington that hadn't even been logged yet... despite sitting out there for hours and hours today... I couldn't resist the possibility of so many FTFs... and out I went. It took an hour to gather them all... and all of them first to finds. But since I was on a roll like that... I couldn't resist grabbing one more cache on my way out of town. So I broke my intention of leaving this cache for a "rainy day"... and stopped by and made the quick find. I loved the camo... but with the clues provided by the CO on the cache page... the search was short. Thanks for a well-done cache on my way out of town, Pastor G!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Great day of solo caching that started @ 6am and by the time 10am was here I had 13 caches found and met Pastor G and his friends who are new to Geocaching. Congrats to him on his 300th find today, Enochs Knob Old Scary Bridge, a cache which I helped place with friends 87preludea20a3 and toadfrommars. The new caches in town are a real treat and represent the town well. Most were placed in the last couple months and they made for an awesome morning of finds. 
Pulled into GZ to see some familiar faces rehiding the freshly found cache, Pastor G and his friends! They couldn't believe that I use a red 2002 35th Anniversary Z28 Camaro Convertible for a cachemobile so Pastor G took my picture with the car to prove to his wife not all Geocachers drive high mileage hybrids. Perfect Independence Day morning for caching and cruising. Thanks Candyce54!!!</groundspeak:text>

I avoided the harsh sunlight as best I could as I traversed Phoenix Park.  Construction was evident and quite understandably halted as the ground cracked around the new structure.  Soon, ground zero was at hand but I was extremely cautious in looking for the cache container.  Areas such as these are known to house wasps in the summer, and the last thing I wanted was another sting!  Thankfully, recovery was quick and painless.  With the log signed, I headed back into the park and towards the car.  Hopefully, the veggies purchased earlier at a roadside stand would still be fine!

I was really hoping to have good weather today and go traipsing through the woods... but the weather didn't make that a real possibility. So we headed towards Washington with the intention of grabbing one of these new caches and some nice caffeine at the Starbucks in Target. Both were accomplished and then we returned home to do chores around the house and a little bit of vegging. The GPS had us looking in one of two places. I chose one... and Ericat chose the right one. Took nothing. Left my signature and a small, marbled, 6-sided die. Thanks for a cache we could grab quickly on an unpredictable weather day, Candy!</groundspeak:text>

Take the trail from the parking lot running between the restrooms and the tennis courts.  The trail will turn to the north.  Look for a magnetic key holder under the bridge near the east end accessible from the south side.  The cache actually sticks down below the metal beam and is visible without using a mirror to look on the other side.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Great day of solo caching that started @ 6am and by the time 10am was here I had 13 caches found and met Pastor G and his friends who are new to Geocaching. Congrats to him on his 300th find today, Enochs Knob Old Scary Bridge, a cache which I helped place with friends 87preludea20a3 and toadfrommars. The new caches in town are a real treat and represent the town well. Most were placed in the last couple months and they made for an awesome morning of finds.

With produce in the car, I was pressed to make the next few finds as quickly as I could.  I parked in a nearby subdivision and walked across a bridge into the park.  The GPS indicated where to go, and I followed with all due gusto.  Searching for the container took a little longer than expected.  A munzee was located and, soon afterward, the cache container.  Now, why didn't I look there first?  [:P]  A signed log was replaced as was the container.  I then made my way to another part of the park to make what I thought would be a quick find . . .

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">(#621) Out caching with Ericat555 this evening. After winding down the paved pathway to GZ... we talked and waited about 5 minutes for all the muggles and their kids and their dogs to move along before we could really search. Despite the GPS pointing right at it... I somehow touched right around it without feeling it the first time. Another 10 minutes of looking and I decided to check down there a little more. Got my head in the right position and my eyes found it before my hands this time. Too nothing. Left my signature and my signature item. Thanks for another cache here in the area, Candy!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">After grabbing the other cache in the park, Cali (geodog) and I set out to walk to the bridge. Well it was a little warm and we almost made it around the lake before Cali was panting and I had to pick her up and carry her (she overheats fast, she only weighs 2.2lb and she is black) well good thing she weighs nothing. Only one other person in the park and she looked like she might be training the couch to 5K so she paid us no mind. We got to the bridge and made a quick grab and headed back to the car. Cali then got to go shopping at Petco!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Thanks for the new caches in town Candy!!  I just went for a walk here the other night to scout out some hiding spots - and then these were released today.  I parked @ Kohls to lengthen my walk - got about 3.5 to 4 miles in!  There were a lot of people on the trail - some of them weren't muggles (nice meeting BMichaels and some of the MWillming gang!).  I probably passed by this one 18 times or so doing my 'figure 8' laps before going for the find.  Good thing I knew the proximity because when I unclipped my GPSr the batteries had gone dead.  Found it easily and good for another SMILEY.  TNLNSL TFTC</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">(#82) TFTC! I had gone to Berger park 3 times a couple of weeks ago... but there were dozens of muggles there... so I didn't even bother to get out of my car and go look. I went this evening with Ericat555 and there were only 3 - 5 other people there... and they looked to be leaving... so we had free reign to wander to the cache. We *almost* took the hard way straight through some nasty looking brush... but then we saw a more well-worn path a few feet down. Whew! That made for an easy walk to a nice cache. Thanks! Took the carabiner... left a Squinkie.</groundspeak:text>

On a cache run with [b][purple]Crowesfeat30[/b][/purple] &amp; [blue]Blue[/blue]. We went to get some caches on our to-do lists, in Union, Washington, Hermann, and Warrenton, and a bunch in between. It took all day, but we got 41 finds.

A nice hide in a park we had all to ourselves today. We could've parked at a better elevation though. Thanks holtycache,

What a blast we had at one of the cache sites, muggles, muggles, muggles everywhere.  I'd say about 2 to 3 thousand of the little guys running around looking for Easter eggs so we kept going and came back later to find (with a little help) the cache.  Really found some nice caches (better than lamp-post type) and we had a very enjoyable day.  Thanks for the nice caches.

However, we could not find it and had to give up when the boys spotted wasps (one of them had gotten stung an hour earlier).</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Out caching with... myself?!?  Well yeah, Lancelot was on his way home.  Dad came to visit me at Lost Valley Lake and when he left I showed him the way to go home.  At least, I showed him the backroads way to Washington, MO.  I needed to go to town anyway just because I needed some meds from a Washington pharmacy.  After picking up the Rx, I decided to clear out the 3 remaining Washington, MO caches I still needed to find.  Mission accomplished!  For this cache, I was confused about which road to take until I found the park.  Even then, I was a bit concerned that I was not in the correct location.  Then I found the cache quickly and wondered why I was so confused.  [:P]  Thanks! [:)]  TNLNSL--Thanks again for the cache!

L Franks had done this one already, it was an easy one for us too. Thanks Mwillming, &amp; we had a great time visiting with all of you at lunch,

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">  4th find - introduced to the "sport" by pastorG and pilothere (brother in laws) while visiting family in Union Missouri.  Hot find on a hot day (104 degrees).  Logging this from Washington state (much cooler) as a new premium member.
Very popular sport in Washington - there are over 1000 caches within 14 miles of my home in Olympia Wa.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I couldn't decide if I should take the high road or the low road to get to this one. I re-read the title and made my decision. I wasn't very long before I spotted the cache - I chose correctly!
When I went to sign the log, I was surprised to see a KC area cacher from Kansas has signed the log right before me - Hey Hockabee, one day I WILL beat you to a cache Somewhere! LOL
As I was returning to my car, I heard a voice ask, "Did you find it?"
It was a friendly muggle neighbor walking the cutest teacup Yorkie. We chatted for a few minutes and he asked some questions about caching. Of course, I told him about some of the amazing places I've been and encouraged him to look up the website.
He told me a great story of the Daniel Boone home not far away and that it might have some spooky non-living residents on the upper floors. I can't wait to go see it on my return trip to the area.
I had tons of fun on this PnG. Thanks for placing it!</groundspeak:text>

Driving down the road, memories of taking this same route over a decade in the past revealed memories of an expansive farm and a somewhat treacherous gravel road.  Little remains of that former landscape these days.  A decent spot to park was found near the coordinates high above as I began looking for the container via flashlight.  Blimey, there were so many places to check!  It was only after a diligent search that the obvious was revealed and the log signed.

I merrily returned to my car as I had obtained a treat from a nearby fast food joint to celebrate a good, long day of caching.  It's rare that one tries a milkshake of the bacon variety and even rarer that it's delicious!  [:D]</groundspeak:text>

Lesson for the newbie like me:  There are a variety of cache containers.  Not all containers are going to look like black film roll cylinders, drab olive camouflage boxes or silver micro bullets.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Great day of solo caching that started @ 6am and by the time 10am was here I had 13 caches found and met Pastor G and his friends who are new to Geocaching. Congrats to him on his 300th find today, Enochs Knob Old Scary Bridge, a cache which I helped place with friends 87preludea20a3 and toadfrommars. The new caches in town are a real treat and represent the town well. Most were placed in the last couple months and they made for an awesome morning of finds. 
Was searching for about 5 mins when Pastor G and his friends pulled up in a hybrid. I eventually made the find after all of us were looking for an additional 10 mins. Really cool meeting them and talking about the caches we had found. Thanks Mwillming!</groundspeak:text>

I talked to eravau last night  ( we just missed each other at the cache and he of course found it) he let a little hint slip, or maybe it didn't SLIP but I caught it...lol Thanks eravau!!...TFTC close to home...sl</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">(#732) I saw the cache name and that it was in Washington... and immediately knew what I was looking for and the general location. I drove over there after doing a little shopping down the road and parked less than 100 feet from the cache. then I walked over to GZ... and didn't find it. So I expanded my search about 30 feet... and still didn't find it. Then I knew I may be at the right coordinates... just not the right altitude. After a little altitude change (walk around the end where that was possible)... I was soon at the GZ again... and the right altitude. There it was. I waited for several muggles to drive by and quickly made the grab, signed the log and left my signature item. Thanks for another cache in this part of Franklin County, Mwillming!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Another smileeeeeeeeeeeeeeey!    I have my geocaching notifications turned off on my cell phone, because I was getting emails in the middle of the night and it was waking my wife up.    So .... I was downstairs working when I noticed 15 minutes later this one had been published.   I figured Eravau would beat me to it, but I had to try.    Sure enough, he was signing the log when I drove up.    He let me sign and then put the cache back in the hiding place the best as I could.   We looked around to see of the c/0 was lurking in the shadows, as usual, but not this time.   Missed FTF by 5 minutes :-(.   I wsa the true 2 to find, but am now logging my visits.   Been a very busy week with Union HS Graduation.   TFTC, Mike!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">(#1,733) I saw the notification for this new cache pop up on my little portable device and pulled up the email. Only 8 miles from home... west? That's Washington or Union! I quickly clicked through to the cache page to see where I would be heading. Washington it is... and only three blocks down from the main thoroughfare!

I quickly grabbed my GPS and keyed in the coordinates and ran for the door probably five minutes after the cache was published. I wasn't sure if any of the Washington locals was paying attention and would beat me there... but I hoped not.

When I arrived... I saw no one near the place where the arrow on the GPS was pointing... and so I pulled up just in front of it and went to work "watching the game" that was going on across the field... while also looking around. After completely missing the cache by looking in the wrong places for a couple of minutes... I finally held my head at just the right angle and saw what I was looking for.

I made the grab and took it over to my car to leave my mark. It was with a smile on my face that I found the FTF line completely blank. And at 8:30 p.m. I signed my {FTF} on the log and dropped one of my signature item in the cache.

Just as I was sealing up the bag with the log... Pastor G drove up with his daughter... flashed his lights and honked at me! I grinned and then handed him the cache as he exited his car and headed my way. We talked for a few minutes... then called the CO and another who had been involved in the cache placement. Then... PG nonchalantly replaced the cache and we hopped in our cars and headed back home.

   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This particular cache overlooks Busch Creek, formerly known as Dubois Creek.  In October 1864 General Sterling Price entered Washington and plundered the town for food and supplies.  The Confederates made their way to the home of beer baron John B. Busch (currently the location of the VFW) and his brewery.  The soldiers after having their fill dumped the remaining barrels of beer into the creek.   '&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You do not have to leave the sidewalk to reach this cache.  It is located on a public right of way.  Do not attempt to park next to GZ.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h4 style="color:red;"&gt;Be sure to check out all of the Washington Mo. historical series&lt;/h4&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

[b][purple]Crowesfeat30[/b][/purple] &amp; I went to Washington, Mo. today with the [b][purple]L Franks[/b][/purple], we just about cleaned out the town and then Union, Mo. too! 66 caches for me &amp; Sarah, a new best day of caching.

An easy find of the cache, but we had a hard time signing the log, it was completely full. But we squeezed our name in anyway, signed as SLAGA4,

Ah, Washington, Missouri!  I attended high-school in this town and have fond memories of living here.  It certainly made it easier to navigate the streets directly to where this cache was hidden.  I parked across the street in an old parking lot that once contained a building.  The last business, if I recall correctly, was a grocery store.  They had some of the best strawberries that were perfect after riding around on one's bicycle.  [:)]

Anyway, I digress.  The cache was easy to locate if a bit unnervingly close to traffic.  That can be blamed solely on the sidewalk, though.  With the log signed, all was replaced as discovered.</groundspeak:text>

Congrats to him on his 300th find today, Enochs Knob Old Scary Bridge, a cache which I helped place with friends 87preludea20a3 and toadfrommars. The new caches in town are a real treat and represent the town well. Most were placed in the last couple months and they made for an awesome morning of finds.

Okay, it was down to the wire now!  With one o'clock on the horizon, I found my way to Stafford Street in no time at all and, eventually, to the geocache coordinates.  Locating the container was a snap, but replacing it was another matter that required a bit of extra work.  Still, everything was replaced as found and in good order.  [:)]  It was time to proceed to the final cache for the day and the eventual destination of New Haven, Missouri!

I was kind of ready for a break. This cache popping up today fit the bill just fine. We parked less than a hundred feet from the cache and just walked over and got it. Although there weren't any finds logged when we left home... we figured somebody would already have FTF by the time we got there... and we were right. The cache was certainly easy to find... especially with the clear marking on there. Thanks for another nearby cache, Mwillming!</groundspeak:text>

We were in town in Washington for lunch... and so before we headed home... we drove over here to see if the cache was actually available... and it was. We may not have had [b]much[/b] time... but we had enough to spend a half hour touring the new facilities and signing the log for the cache. Nothing to take. No room to leave anything but a signature. Thanks for keeping this one active, Candy!</groundspeak:text>

Greetings,

It has been a while since I first looked at this cache. I can't find any recent responses about maintaining this cache so for the time being it will be archived and removed from the active cache listings. We are no longer leaving caches stay disabled for extended periods of time. 

Groundspeak and the geocaching community appreciate your contributions to geocaching and I hope to see this cache back in operation soon.  

If you can get it back up and running in the next week or so contact me to get it re-listed. Otherwise plan to move it slightly and set up a new cache page.  


[B][green]Most problems can be solved with good communication so reply back to the reviewer and we will do everything possible within the guidelines to get your cache published. It is best to give me as much information as possible instead of saying nothing at all. This will speed up the process and we can get your cache published. [/green][/b]

Greetings,

I am once again checking all the disabled caches in the area to see if any progress has been made on repairs.

I know that schedules can be hectic and time short but I do hope that you find the time to repair this cache.
[b]
If not repaired, this one is scheduled to be archived next month on my next check of disabled caches.
[/b] 

If you plan on having this up and running by next check then you can skip over this notice. 


From the guidelines...       http://www.geocaching.com/about/guidelines.aspx#maint      "... You may temporarily disable your cache to let others know not to hunt for it until you have a chance to fix the problem.  This feature is to allow you a reasonable time,[b]  normally a few weeks , [/b] in which to arrange a visit to your cache. In the event that a cache is not being properly maintained, or has been temporarily disabled for an extended period of time, we may archive or transfer the listing."  

Thanks for your understanding.

When you have made all repairs, please  remember to post an "Owner Maintenance" log on your cache page. This log restores the cache to its fully-functional state and allows your cache to be shown in the search results of Pocket Queries. Don't let your cache be filtered out unnecessarily in Pocket Queries by forgetting to re-set the attribute!


[B][Green]Most problems can be solved with good communication so reply back to the reviewer and we will do everything possible within the guidelines to get your cache published. It is best to give me as much information as possible instead of saying nothing at all. This will speed up the process and we can get your cache published. [/green][/b]

I realized that I had forgotten to discover a couple of travel bugs that were in this cache... so today I made my way back over here to do so. When I got to GZ... I didn't see the cache container in the place where I had found it... and then left it. A few minutes later, though, I found it in what is probably a little better spot 10 feet away from where I expected it. I"m already carrying around enough TBs that I didn't want to add another to my pack... but I took note of the codes of the ones in there... put everything back where it belongs... and headed on my way. Thanks again for this series, guys!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">OCW Pilothear and Philgoerge on a very hot Independence Day 2012!    We got all the individual caches this morning and afternoon and then headed over to get the final.  Philgorege's wife, PattyAddy, was along with us and made the find.   She was pumped and I think a new convert to geocaching!   Best selection of swag I have ever seen.   Took nothing but the serial #'s of two TB's to record as "discovered".    Great series!   Thanks for all the hard work, it was very much appreciated and gave us a reason to get it of the house today.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Great day of solo caching that started @ 6am and by the time 10am was here I had 13 caches found and met Pastor G and his friends who are new to Geocaching. Congrats to him on his 300th find today, Enochs Knob Old Scary Bridge, a cache which I helped place with friends 87preludea20a3 and toadfrommars. The new caches in town are a real treat and represent the town well. Most were placed in the last couple months and they made for an awesome morning of finds. 
Thanks for all the new caches, Benedictjams. It was fun collecting the needed data and touring town a little more thoroughly than I had before. Really cool spots for all the caches. Giving this one a favorite point for all the effort put into this series and since I had a great time leading up to this cache. Good job!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">(#759) Well... I had found all of the preliminary caches in the history series. The puzzle of the coordinates was fairly straightforward... but I was a bit unsure about the digit for [b]C[/b]. None the less.. I used my calculations and entered the coordinates... and then drove to where they took me. Once I arrived at the destination... I [b]knew[/b] it had to be the right place. I parked my car and began following the arrow... and then realized that either the cache was inside a building... or else I was on the wrong side of the building. I hoped it was the later. Once I walked around the building... I realized with relief that the coordinates did indeed point to the other side of the building... not inside of it. After a few minutes of looking around... and an hour after I had left home this evening I made the find on this cache at 9:56 p.m. I opened the cache to a treasure trove of trinkets. There were indeed some cool things in there... but I didn't have any swag on the same level with me to be trading tonight... so I left it all there. The hunt for three more caches and this final tonight was an adventure... and much more pleasant with 20° cooler temperatures than my hunt this afternoon... but with the {FTF} on this one... I ended up with five first to finds today. I doubt I'll ever top that one... but I can dream. [:)]

Thanks for the excellent hides... the interesting history... and an excuse not to sleep when I probably needed to do so tonight, benedictjams and Mwillming! I hope to run into you guys around town.</groundspeak:text>

&lt;span&gt;At the cache location you can see the Beyreis-Godt House.  It is the oldest remaining building in Washington and dates to 1835.  Recently the building has served as the offices of the Washington Downtown Inc. Completed in 1922, the building at the corner of Second and Lafayette serves as a post office. Originally there was lookout extending from the basement to the roof so that inspectors could spy on the clerks. Today, the building is owned by the Washington Downtown Inc. and it continues to be a full service post office for the town of Washington.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;h4 style="color:red;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now that you have found this cache, locate the the Memorial Garden stone a few yards away from the first location discussed above and add all the numbers in the date to calculate the check sum (x+x+x+x+x+x=D).   Plug in for letter D in the finale cache "I Didn't Know That." Then head toward the Post Office and locate the street address of that building and calculate the check sum (x+x+x=C). Place the answer for letter C in the finale cache "I Didn't Know That."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Great day of solo caching that started @ 6am and by the time 10am was here I had 13 caches found and met Pastor G and his friends who are new to Geocaching. Congrats to him on his 300th find today, Enochs Knob Old Scary Bridge, a cache which I helped place with friends 87preludea20a3 and toadfrommars. The new caches in town are a real treat and represent the town well. Most were placed in the last couple months and they made for an awesome morning of finds. 
Spent an embarrasing long time here but I eventually made the find. Thanks benedictjams!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">(#756) When I got home from church tonight and saw that nobody had logged three of this series (plus the final)... I debated on whether to drive the 20 minutes back to Washington. Were they actually found and just not logged yet... or were they actually left unfound... all these many hours and hours after they had been released into the wild? Well... I let the seed of insanity take root... and it grew and it grew. The possibility of more first to finds in one day than I've ever gotten before (previous record: 1)... was too much for me to pass up. So at 8:56 p.m... I headed out to do some caching.

I got to this one first. I had actually driven over to this one after my earlier find at #4 this afternoon. When I got out of my car... I saw a couple of girls running away from what I [b]thought[/b] was ground zero... and so thinking the FTF was already gone... I headed on home. And yet there were no logs here even after hours. When I got there tonight... I realized that the area they were running from... was [b]actually[/b] across the street from GZ. I hadn't been paying enough attention. Maybe I [b]could[/b] still be the first to find this one too.

Once I got to GZ (the [b]real[/b] GZ... I searched a couple of places casually. But every time I tried to do a real search... another car would drive by. Don't these people have homes and families and beds to go home to? [:D] Once I finally got an opening... I did a good search of where I thought it should be... and it [b]was[/b]. I put my hand on it... then heard another car coming... and pulled my hand away. It drove by and I opened the lid... and heard another car... and pulled my hand away.

Finally I got the log out and checked it. It was empty! So I signed my {FTF} at the top and dropped my signature item in the container... then waited for a few more cars to pass before I got the lid on and everything back in place.

Thanks for this cache.. the beginning of my evening's adventure, benedictjams and Mwillming! This is too much fun.</groundspeak:text>

   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;From this cache you can see the Washington Waterworks building which was first built in 1889, after many city meetings. The town of Washington had no active &lt;nobr&gt;&lt;a class="FAtxtL" href="http://rediscoverwashington.wordpress.com/2012/01/31/then-now-the-waterworks-building-revisited/#"&gt;plumbing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/nobr&gt; system until this time except for the neighbors of Henry Tibbe. Henry had set op an ornate water tank with a windmill to pump the water into the tank. In 1886 his tank also supplied water for other families in the Fourth and Cedar Streets area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally, water was pumped from the river into a large reservoir on the south side of Front Street (between Jefferson and Lafayette Streets). From this holding tank, the water flowed by gravity back to the Waterworks and into an open reservoir on the east side of the building (now covered by soil in the park area). The water was then pumped into the pipes serving the community. A stand-pipe, holding 125, 000 gallons of reserve water was located on Fifth Street (near the present-day parsonage of the Lutheran Church).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pumps for those operations were located in a twenty ft. deep pit inside the Waterworks building. Steam to drive the pumps was produced by large, coal fueled &lt;nobr&gt;&lt;a class="FAtxtL" href="http://rediscoverwashington.wordpress.com/2012/01/31/then-now-the-waterworks-building-revisited/#"&gt;boilers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/nobr&gt; located on the ground level floor of the building, called the “boiler rooms”. Steam from the boilers also provided the pressure to operate a whistle used to alert the community and the Volunteer Fire Department to any Emergency. Consequently, The Independent &lt;nobr&gt;&lt;a class="FAtxtL" href="http://rediscoverwashington.wordpress.com/2012/01/31/then-now-the-waterworks-building-revisited/#"&gt;Telephone Company&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/nobr&gt; assigned number “one” to the telephone located at the Waterworks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 style="color:red;"&gt;From the location of this cache, look slightly to the northwest and count the number of flag poles at the James Rennick Riverfront Park.  Use that number for the A coordinate in the finale cache "I Didn't Know That."&lt;/h4&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

We got a few blocks away and sure enough, we got the call ... They got it.   We turned around and went back.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Had just finished a nice walk on the riverfront trail.  On the way had kinda gauged where I thought a couple of caches might be so when we came up to the street and saw 4 guys poking around the tree and vines.......  Couldn't resist stopping to ask "did you find it?".   So, us two girls had to stop and show them how it's done.   Great cache.   Sometimes we make them more difficult than they need to be.  

Nice to meet PastorG.  Sorry can't remember the names of the others.  Sounds like PastorG has hooked a couple of newbies.  Let one of them take the trackable.  Sounds like it will be headed to the northwest coast.  TFTC!!</groundspeak:text>

Congrats to him on his 300th find today, Enochs Knob Old Scary Bridge, a cache which I helped place with friends 87preludea20a3 and toadfrommars. The new caches in town are a real treat and represent the town well. Most were placed in the last couple months and they made for an awesome morning of finds. 
This was an unexpected tough hide, but I got it after several minutes of searching. Thanks Mwillming!</groundspeak:text>

I walked over and knew the obvious area where I needed to be looking. But with all the muggle traffic driving by on the riverfront that I needed to dodge the attention of... and all the places to look... and the with the darkness... it took me a little while to come up with the cache. But come up with it I did. And imagine my surprise when I found yet another empty log in this series... hours after it came out. I signed my name as {FTF} at the top of the log and dropped in three of my signature item since I grabbed the geocaching pin.

&lt;p&gt;The cache is approximately .7 miles from the Riverfront Park parking lot, and 1.6 miles from the east parking lot. Permission was obtained from the Washington Parks Dept.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="4" color="purple"&gt;&lt;b&gt;When we first started geocaching, we avoided all the micros in our area because they seemed like more trouble than they were worth. But as we've gotten more geocaching experience under our belts, we've come to appreciate micros and think of them as more as geo fortune cookies--little treats not too far off the beaten path that can help satisfy your craving. Just open one up, pull out the slip of paper, and you know it's going to be a good day!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is part of a series of 3 "fortune cookies." Each can be logged as a Find independently of the other 2. Each one also contains information that can be used to find a larger bonus cache. Be sure to look inside each one and write down the clues given. (You will need the name of the cache and the Lucky Number to find the bonus cache.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;&lt;font face="Tahoma" color="black" size="4"&gt;&lt;font face="Tahoma" color="black" size="4"&gt;The other caches in this series are:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">(#462) OCW Ericat555 today. I wanted to find a cache today and my wife wanted to run a few errands in Washington... so I had her drop Ericat555 and I off at the riverfront parking lot. So we walked the nicely-paved trail to this one and made quick work of finding it once we got to ground zero. Then we signed the log and headed back to the parking lot, where my wife was waiting after running her errands. It was only after we drove away that I realized that I hadn't looked at the magic number from this cache. Fortunately, I'll be back by to grab it soon when we take the trail past it to the "Year of the Dragon" cache. Thanks for a nice walk on a nice day, L Frank!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Out in the Washington area for some caching with Mrs RGS. Parked in this lot to pick up the caches on the trail going up to the HW 47 bridge. Perfect day for a walk along here.

This was last of the series and easiest to spot. I didn't have the FC cache page with me so I looked up the cache page on my phone and did the math for the final. Since i was already 1/2hr late getting back to the car, and a 2 mile walk to get to the car, I decided to save this for my next trip to Washington. Thanks John and Laurie for 3/4 of the series.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I really enjoyed this series.  The hardest thing about it was the hints!  They made it much harder to find the caches.  I do not understand the hints as none of the caches are flood proof.  I may be LTF if the flood waters come up much higher.

The log is soaked in this one.  I would say if the river comes up two or three more feet, this one will float down the MO.

Decided to do the bike trail and some caching today.  Had a great time.   The trail was open except the end in downtown was underwater.  This is a really nice trail to bike and I really enjoyed it. It was neat seeing the MO River roaring by.  Thanks.</groundspeak:text>

We stopped at a nearby local institutional legend (Aldo's Pizza) for lunch before heading off to this round of caches.  Perhaps we should have waited to eat Aldo's until after finding the caches because the sky opened up and poured on us soaking us to the bones as soon as we hit the caching trail.  Oh well, we were hungry and all worked out well--if not wet.  Thanks for this series of caches!  [:)] TNLNSL--Thanks again for the cache!

Bikeway in Washington, Missouri. Please park at one of the 2
parking lots listed, as these are the only safe spots to cross the
railroad tracks to access the caches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is approximately .8 miles from the Riverfront Park
parking lot, and 1.5 miles from the east parking lot. Permission
was obtained from the Washington Parks Dept.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="4" color="purple"&gt;&lt;b&gt;When we first started
geocaching, we avoided all the micros in our area because they
seemed like more trouble than they were worth. But as we've gotten
more geocaching experience under our belts, we've come to
appreciate micros and think of them as more as geo fortune
cookies--little treats not too far off the beaten path that can
help satisfy your craving. Just open one up, pull out the slip of
paper, and you know it's going to be a good day!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;This cache is part of a series of 3 "fortune cookies." Each can
be logged as a Find independently of the other 2. Each one also
contains information that can be used to find a larger bonus cache.
Be sure to look inside each one and write down the clues given.
(You will need the name of the cache and the Lucky Number to find
the bonus cache.)&lt;/p&gt;

In town for business, so I didn't worry about the secret code number, maybe in the summer I'll come back and do that.  No muggles on the trail so no one saw me sneak into the woods to capture this cache.  Loved the container and the log was in very good condition.  Very cool trees and interesting landscape - beautiful view of the river to go along with it.  Signed the log and high-tailed it back to the car and the heater.  TFTC.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I really enjoyed this series.  The hardest thing about it was the hints!  They made it much harder to find the caches.  I do not understand the hints as none of the caches are flood proof.  I may be LTF if the flood waters come up much higher.

The log is nice and dry.  I would say if the river comes up 6 more inches this one will be floating.  This one I had lots of trouble with.  The area the cache was in was mostly under water and my GPS was pointing to the water mostly.  I looked for a flood proof cache for quite a while in the dry area and gave up.  Then I went and found Rat and since it was not flood proof either, I decided to come back and look for a non flood proof cache.  Found it right away then.

Decided to do the bike trail and some caching today.  Had a great time.   The trail was open except the end in downtown was underwater.  This is a really nice trail to bike and I really enjoyed it. It was neat seeing the MO River roaring by.  Thanks.</groundspeak:text>

   <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Located on the Rotary Riverfront Trail section of the Washington
Bikeway in Washington, Missouri. Please park at one of the 2
parking lots listed, as these are the only safe spots to cross the
railroad tracks to access the caches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is approximately 1.25 miles from the Riverfront Park
parking lot, and 1 mile from the east parking lot. Permission was
obtained from the Washington Parks Dept.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="4" color="purple"&gt;&lt;b&gt;When we first started
geocaching, we avoided all the micros in our area because they
seemed like more trouble than they were worth. But as we've gotten
more geocaching experience under our belts, we've come to
appreciate micros and think of them as more as geo fortune
cookies--little treats not too far off the beaten path that can
help satisfy your craving. Just open one up, pull out the slip of
paper, and you know it's going to be a good day!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is part of a series of 3 "fortune cookies." Each can
be logged as a Find independently of the other 2. Each one also
contains information that can be used to find a larger bonus cache.
Be sure to look inside each one and write down the clues given.
(You will need the name of the cache and the Lucky Number to find
the bonus cache.)&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">(#461) I was in Washington today and wanted to get at least one today... so I parked at the eastern trailhead, which is on the way home. I walked the mile or so to the cache without seeing anyone... and easily made my way to the cache. I even saw it from about 80 feet away. When I got there and tried to retrieve it though... I had a little trouble. The location it had been placed in was full of water... water that had frozen in the frigid temperatures we've been having this week. A bit of tugging and prying made it clear the cache wasn't moving. So I tried to unscrew the lid to get at the log anyway. I still had to pry on the container to put the smallest amount of space between the lid and the side of its hidey hole and then turn the lid 'til it came off. Once I got it off I began the process of trying to pull out the log. Thanks for the cord to pull it out by... but whatever hard object was in the center of the log also made it impossible to get the log pulled out of its container. I [b]was[/b] able to get about 1" - 2" of log pulled above the top of the container though... and signed and dated that edge.

Once I exited the woods... a guy walking the trail caught up with me and we got into a conversation and discovered that we were both cachers. So thanks for the great adventure of a cache and the chance to meet another cacher, L Frank!</groundspeak:text>

Zounds!  Extracting this cache from its hiding spot proved impossible as it was frozen into place!  Thankfully my fingers were dexterous enough to open the cache, sign the log and obtain yet another lucky number.  Wait, it's over there?!

On a cache run with [b][purple]Crowesfeat30[/b][/purple] &amp; [blue]Blue[/blue]. We went to get some caches on our to-do lists, in Union, Washington, Hermann, and Warrenton, and a bunch in between. It took all day, but we got 41 finds.

The nettles weren't as bad here as at Nightengale, &amp; the skeeters were getting blown around too much to be a big bother. Quick find, thanks Denmother &amp; LFrank,

The log is soaked in this one.  I would say if the river comes up four or five more feet, this one will float down the MO.

Decided to do the bike trail and some caching today.  Had a great time.   The trail was open except the end in downtown was underwater.  This is a really nice trail to bike and I really enjoyed it. It was neat seeing the MO River roaring by.  Thanks.</groundspeak:text>

After finding the preceding three in the series... ericat555 and I headed out to grab this one on this beautiful afternoon. To say the Riverfront Trail was busy today would in no way be a lie. We had to stand there and talk about the beautiful trees and point at interesting things for 5 minutes or so once we found the cache... before we could pull it out and take care of business. Once they all passed, though, the log was quickly extracted, signed and replaced in its container.

Now that is one large fortune cookie!  Its luck seemed to permeate the area as a large tree branch had crashed down on the trail while I was after the other caches (and seemingly didn't hit anyone).  A blanket was tangled up in the broken pieces and probably had been up there for quite some time.  Could the wind have just caught it at the wrong angle?  Who knows?

The cache was in good shape and keeping out of trouble.  Well, except for a pen that just wouldn't write.  It was quickly substituted with a working one.

Rode my bike for the first time this year and enjoyed the trek down the bike path. But I'll probably be sore tomorrow. I found the Rat and the Monkey, but came up short on the Dragon. But I juggled the numbers and made a couple of assumptions and walked right to this one. This was a very nice hide in this area. Thanks for placing these caches.

The log is soaked in this one.  This one has the best chance of surviving the flooding-but it still could be lost.

Decided to do the bike trail and some caching today.  Had a great time.   The trail was open except the end in downtown was underwater.  This is a really nice trail to bike and I really enjoyed it. It was neat seeing the MO River roaring by.  Thanks.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I was out caching with 2_cats after their "Young Eagles" event.  We stopped at a nearby local institutional legend (Aldo's Pizza) for lunch before heading off to this round of caches.  Perhaps we should have waited to eat Aldo's until after finding the caches because the sky opened up and poured on us soaking us to the bones as soon as we hit the caching trail.  Oh well, we were hungry and all worked out well--if not wet.  Thanks for this series of caches!  [:)] TNLNSL--Thanks again for the cache!

Caching with BlueBeadMan who had not gotten these yet. This will be the last one as it looks like the rain isn't going to stop.

Easy finds, but lots of poison ivy in the area. Lil' Cat was still getting over poison ivy from a few weeks ago, so she stayed on the path for most of these. Whimp ;-)</groundspeak:text>

   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p style="border-bottom:black solid 5px;clear:both;font-weight:bold;"&gt;Current Events&lt;img src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/06008e2b-e4a0-4257-9f3e-e41cab8a47e6.jpg" alt="Section 1" style="float:right;margin:0px 15px 5px 15px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Living in the Missouri River valley, one hears many a tale of the changes it has endured over the years. Riverfront towns such as Augusta found themselves landlocked when the main waterflow altered course. Dykes and dredging have constrained what was once a considerably wide and shallow channel leaving fertile farmland. The most drastic evidence of the area changing, however, is not often pondered. &lt;b&gt;How did such a body of water carve the bluffs that now line its banks?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="border-bottom:black solid 5px;clear:both;font-weight:bold;"&gt;Wouldn't It Be Ice?&lt;img src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/d281201e-6dd7-47c8-8934-f8b677c3efae.jpg" alt="Section 2" style="float:right;margin:0px 15px 5px 15px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To answer our question, let's look at the weather during one particular period of history: the Pleistocene Epoch. It was a turbulent time between 1.65 million and 10 thousand years ago that saw cycles of warming and cooling. These cooler periods of roughly 100 thousand years each are commonly known as &lt;i&gt;ice ages&lt;/i&gt;. Glaciers and ice sheets would extend south helped along into warmer climates by ice pressure. The fluctuating appearance of these incursions, or &lt;i&gt;glaciations&lt;/i&gt;, can be attributed to a phenomenon known as the Milankovitch theory. Continental drift, ocean currents, the tilt of the Earth and solar radiation all play a part in how long ice can be sustained on the surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Missouri, until the late Pleistocene, didn't undergo &lt;i&gt;glaciation&lt;/i&gt;. Prior to the Illinoian period (302 thousand to 132 thousand years ago), glacial advances would rarely if ever reach as far south as the current northern border of the state of Missouri. A portion of the present day Missouri River was but a tributary to a much grander ancient Kansas River lined by spruce trees. The Kansas drained, as many other bodies of water did, toward the Hudson to the northeast. So, what changed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ice sheets invaded the area numerous times during the Illinoian period recreating the geomorphology. Topography was altered and rivers were forced to change course as their former beds were filled and smoothed by advancing ice (&lt;i&gt;glaciation&lt;/i&gt; at work). New bodies of water formed both within the ice sheets and along their edges when the climate warmed. It is believed that the Missouri River in the self-named state was formed at this time through &lt;i&gt;ice-marginal drainage&lt;/i&gt;. Meltwater followed the edge of an ice sheet in such quantity that it altered the landscape over time creating the bluffs we know today. &lt;i&gt;Jökulhlaups&lt;/i&gt;, or sudden bursts of water from interglacial lakes flowing out from underneath a frozen formation, may have also contributed. The new river valley widened more where ancient river systems were exposed by new erosion. Eventually, as the last ice sheet receded, the Missouri River calmed to its present state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing where the Missouri River runs presently provides a fair estimate of how far the ice sheets advanced. The southernmost point is approximately three and a half miles to the east-southeast of this cache's posted coordinates. Unfortunately, that location is on private property and cannot be visited by the public. One can still step into the past along the Rotary Riverfront Trail and make an observation or two. The trail was established on a &lt;i&gt;floodplain&lt;/i&gt;, or a low lying area susceptible to influxes of water from a nearby source. Nutrients from silt are often left behind when flooding occurs creating fertile land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="border-bottom:black solid 5px;clear:both;font-weight:bold;"&gt;A Ferry Decent Measure&lt;img src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/5f4a55bf-9de9-4998-9676-bf6063101a73.jpg" alt="Section 3" style="float:right;margin:0px 15px 5px 15px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bluffs that once held back torrential quantities of water indicate the width of an early and much larger Missouri River. The river and its surrounding &lt;i&gt;floodplain&lt;/i&gt; today can be measured to provide a brief glimpse into that past. All that is needed is one's eyesight and perhaps a calculator at the posted coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look to the north-northeast at the distant bluffs and hill at the posted coordinates. Hold your arm straight out in front of you, and make a fist with your thumb held level horizontally in front of your eyes. From the top of the opposite river bank to the top of the aforementioned hill, count how tall it is in whole and partial thumbnail widths. Write this down as &lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, take an elevation reading next to the sign. This value is &lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subtract &lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt; from the approximate elevation of the distant rise, 840 feet. Divide by &lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;, then multiply by 30 (a generalized ratio of eye to thumb line-of-sight). Add 930 to account for the distance behind you to the aft bluff. This provides a very rough estimation of the width requested in feet. Divide by 5280 to convert this distance to miles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please answer the following queries to log this EarthCache as found. Responses can be sent to Unitzoid through the link for that username at the top of this page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) Name the geological term shared by both the sign at the posted coordinates and this EarthCache description.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) What process(es) initially formed the bluffs lining the Missouri River?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) What width was provided by your measurements? Does it seem reasonable? Why or why not?&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Another smileeeeeeeeee!   OCW my daughter, who knew I needed a break.  Just now getting around to logging it.   I've often wondered why there was not an earth cache here in Washington, and now there is!   Email sent with necessary information to the CO.  Thanks so much .. I love earth caches!  Definitely giving a favorite, as I do all my earth caches.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Went down the trail today and couldn't finish this one.  The grass and trees prevented me from seeing anything on the other side of the river (north/northeast) or the river itself.  So, I had no way to make the measurements for #3.

Edit:  

Unitzoid informed me that the bluffs to the left of sign work.  He also suggested I look at a topo map, at which point it became clear to me how distinct and large the Missouri river floodplain is, especially compared to the current channel.  Quite neat.

So I understand now that the bluffs are pretty much continuous, and any viewable bluff will work.  Changed from DNF to Found.

TFTC!

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I sent the answers via e-mail - hope I saw the right hill/bluff.  I always enjoy my time on this trail - it wasn't here when I was a kid growing up in WashMO, but I'm glad it is now.  Great to bike, walk, and CACHE along!!  Thanks for getting me out here this evening Unitzoid!  I really never thought about the idea of an earthcache in town - other than what  I believe is the southern most point of the Missouri River (is that your point you refer to?) which is adjacent to private property.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">(#1,702) I saw this one pop up on the radar two nights ago... after the park / trail had already closed for the night... so there was no caching to be done then. Besides... there would would be no way to see and measure the hill. Then I had to work all day yesterday... and attend a program at my daughter's school last night 'til well after dark... so that was out. Today it was back to work again... and so I was leaving another whole day for some of our locals to get out and find the requisite info to claim this cache.

I got home from work tonight and got settled in front of the TV and pulled up e cache page to see who had claimed it. But nobody had! I change back outta my comfy clothes and into my "go caching" clothes and went downstairs to head out the door. As I was about to leave... Ericat555 asked me where I was going... and I told her of an {FTF} to be had on a new earthcache. I hadn't invited her along since she had always been turning me down when I asked lately. But this evening she wanted to come along... and so she got herself ready and we took off.

Twenty minutes later we were parked at the eastern parking area and heading down the trail... in the rather heavy rain! Another 20 minutes or so later... we arrived at GZ... soaking wet... but laughing at ourselves for being silly enough to come out in this weather.

Te hill was just barely visible in the distance... but it was seen... and the measurements were taken! Then the sign was read and the elevation found... and then a few pictures were taken to prove our insanity. Then we walked back almost a mile to the car... counting the earthworms wiggling on the trail.

After that.. cold and wet... we drove over to reward ourselves at the Starbucks in the Target... where I sit typing this log on my iPad. Ericat is shivering like she's sitting on top of one of those glaciers mentioned above... and I'm hoping I dry off before morning.

Tanks for some great geological history... and my first earthcache FTF... and a trip to remember, Unitzoid! I loved it!</groundspeak:text>

&lt;span&gt;The Washington Farmer's Market is the oldest remaining structure on Main Street. It was built by the Bleckman family in 1856 to house their furniture and undertaking business. Across the street is St. Francis Borgia Church. In 1833, twelve Catholic families arrived in Washington from Germany. The first Catholic Church was built near the present day St. Francis Borgia Cemetary and soon became too small. A new church was built in 1846 just west of the present church site on Main Street. The current building dates from 1869. Looking north toward the Missouri River, you will see Marquart's Landing. Originally the building was built by CH Kahmann as a tavern and hotel to accomodate passengers on the new Pacific Railroad. It continues to be a tavern.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;h4 style="color:red;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now that you have found this cache, count the number of letters in the first word under the Riverboat.  Plug in for letter E in the finale cache "I Didn't Know That."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

As others have posted, the coordinates for this one are just a bit off.  Consider what you're looking for in terms of information and the find will be a little easier.  [;)]  I gathered the final data for the mystery cache as the log was replaced with a new signature.  Hmm . . . could it be?  It just might!  I had to hurry, though, as I was due in New Haven to visit my father about fifteen minutes from the time of the find.

I recall visiting this parking lot when it was pretty new during a sampling fair more than a decade and a half ago.  Wimpy's had a stand and offered smaller versions of their famous brain burgers.  Of course, I had no idea of this and sampled one.  It wasn't disgusting, just . . . bland.  Ah, well.  There were plenty of booths and table from which to sample other intriguing items at the time.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">OK this was the 3rd and hardest of the day!  [}:)]  We looked and felt and then we were sweating to death.  Ok I tell my husband you have to turn the air conditioning on in the car Cali is panting hard and starting to over heat.  You see Cali is our 3 year old YorkiePoo that only weighs 2.2 lbs and she is black and over heats super fast.  So we put her in the car and my husband goes down low and no luck.  Sweat is now dripping and we decide to give up.  We drive up to the gas station on 5th street and get a drink and I read a post that says catch was found to the East so we go back and go to the other lot and guess what......It is way off to the EAST [?] .  Again though Bob makes the find but I am sent to retrieve it and sign the log. Counted our letters and was on our way again.  TFTC</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Great day of solo caching that started @ 6am and by the time 10am was here I had 13 caches found and met Pastor G and his friends who are new to Geocaching. Congrats to him on his 300th find today, Enochs Knob Old Scary Bridge, a cache which I helped place with friends 87preludea20a3 and toadfrommars. The new caches in town are a real treat and represent the town well. Most were placed in the last couple months and they made for an awesome morning of finds. 
Spent several minutes here then read the description all the way, which gave me a better idea where to look. Thanks benedictjams!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">(#755) {FTF} at 2:36 p.m. (though I think I mis-wrote 12:36 p.m. in my haste and inability to clearly see my phone's screen in the bright sunlight). I got home from finding #1 in this series after lunch today and after logging it... saw that another had appeared in this series. Oh well... I figured... all the FTF hounds that live in Washington will be racing for that one. Then I saw another... and another pop up. Okay... I thought... I might have a shot with [b]that[/b] many to go around. So with the hope of an FTF filling my thoughts... I made the 20 minute drive back to Washington.

Figuring that others would go for the "closer" ones first... I headed for the furthest of the three from the main part of town... driving right by two of the caches. I parked less than 100 feet from GZ and walked over to where the GPS said it would be. I looked and felt around... but didn't see anything. Then I expanded my search to one side and looked all over... but still nothing. Then I reread a bit of the description and headed the other direction.. and after a couple of minutes of checking near where that had led me... I felt the cache. Then I pulled on the cache... and pulled a little harder... and then it came loose. [:D] It's certainly not going to fall from its hiding spot.

I hopefully unfolded the log and saw that it was blank. Aaah... the beauty of an unsoiled cache log. What can compare to it? [:D] I signed my name and left my signature item and was on my way.

After leaving... I decided that I might actually have a shot at a second FTF today... so I stopped by one of the other two in the area. And as I walked towards it... I saw someone dropping something and running away... and knew I was too late... so I just headed on home... leaving that one for a day when I need a close-by cache to be handy.

Thanks for the adventure this afternoon, benedcitjams and Mwillming!</groundspeak:text>

   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;div class="DialogBox"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anton Tibbe brought electricity to Washington in 1893. This building, the third plant was built in 1904 and went on-line in December 1915 with much fanfare. The building housed two 75 horsepower generators. Just down the block is one of Washington's most well-known industries. Washington, Missouri has long been known as the "Corn Cob Pipe Capital of the World." It was the Missouri Meerschaum Company, still the world's oldest and largest manufacturer of the cool, sweet-smelling corn cob pipes, that began the tradition for which Washington became famous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1869 Henry Tibbe, a Dutch immigrant woodworker, first began production of the corn cob pipe. Legend has it that a local farmer whittled a pipe out of corn cob and liked it so much he asked Henry Tibbe to try turning some on his lathe. The farmer was well-pleased with his pipes so Henry made a few more and put them for sale in his shop. They proved to be such a fast selling item that soon Tibbe spent more time making pipes for his customers than working with wood. Soon Tibbe went into &lt;nobr&gt;&lt;a class="FAtxtL" href="http://www.corncobpipe.com/pages.php?pageid=4#"&gt;full time&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/nobr&gt; production of corn cob pipes. In 1907, the H. Tibbe &amp;amp; Son Co. became the Missouri Meerschaum Company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word Meerschaum is taken from a German word that means "sea foam". It is a Turkish clay used in high grade pipes. Tibbe likened his light, porous pipes and their cool smoke to that of the more expensive meerschaum pipes and coined the name "Missouri Meerschaum" for his pipes. Tibbe and a chemist friend devised an innovative system of &lt;nobr&gt;&lt;a class="FAtxtL" href="http://www.corncobpipe.com/pages.php?pageid=4#"&gt;applying&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/nobr&gt; a plaster-based substance to the outside of the corn cob bowls. In 1878, Tibbe patented this &lt;nobr&gt;&lt;a class="FAtxtL" href="http://www.corncobpipe.com/pages.php?pageid=4#"&gt;process&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/nobr&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A nationwide distribution system was established for the sale of his pipes. Other pipe firms also developed; by 1925 there were as many as a dozen corn cob pipe companies in Franklin County, most of them in Washington. Today, Missouri Meerschaum stands alone as the first and only surviving piece of the living history.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The factory is located on the corner of Front and Cedar streets overlooking the Missouri River and one block from the Amtrak station. The three story brick building that houses the factory dates to the 1880's.&lt;/p&gt;

Lines were crossed and confusion abounded while I looked for information pertaining to the mystery cache.  It turned out I had two cache descriptions switched!  Things were sorted and the correct information easily found.  The geocache itself was also straight-forward and quickly signed.  Next up:  the last piece of the puzzle!</groundspeak:text>

Congrats to him on his 300th find today, Enochs Knob Old Scary Bridge, a cache which I helped place with friends 87preludea20a3 and toadfrommars. The new caches in town are a real treat and represent the town well. Most were placed in the last couple months and they made for an awesome morning of finds.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">(#758) When I got down to this end of the street... there was hardly any traffic... but it wasn't [b]completely[/b] empty. About three quarters of a block up where I parked there was a group of guys sitting around talking. But I was far enough away that they couldn't see what I was doing down at the cache.

All of these caches made for interesting history... but for some reason I liked this one the best. The idea that these guys somehow made an "industry" out of corn cobs turned into pipes... is astounding. Besides that... the building where this cache took me seemed rather beautiful.

This was definitely the easiest find of the series... and again awarded me with an {FTF} when I pulled out the empty log. I dropped in two of my signature item... and picked up the FTF geocoin. I'll move it along to somewhere soon. Thanks for my favorite cache in the series, Mwillming and benedictjams!</groundspeak:text>

OCW Rainman today and found this Grand Old Fellow location - we searched all hiding places by hand and with flashlights - and because of the posted cache size, we believe it was muggled.  We Replaced the cache with a temporary and installed a new log.  If you later confirm we did so in error we will be glad to delete the find logs and come back again someday.

We both felt this was missing.  We dropped off a micro container, if the CO feels we missed the real cache, we will be glad to delete our log as found.  We spent a lot of time in the tree and felt 100 per cent that the cache was missing.

I put together a route of caches that neither Bernie or I had done and it ended up bringing us out to Warrenton, down through Washington and then through Pacific before bringing us toward home on Route 100. We got around 30 caches plus or minus.  This was one of the finds. Wow, what an old tree. I can see where it got its name. Talked to a young Mom and daughter who was walking a large English Mastiff named Grindle. All in all, a neat cache.  Thanks Candyce54, this was cache 7 of 33.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">As the Washington Amateur Radio Hamfest was winding down, I ran into Geocacher Jusified and did a few Geocaches. We got to see a unique rare car in operation. The car look like it just came off of the car dealers show room floor. This unique car is a AQUA CAR. You can drive the car into a lake and now it is  motor Boat. This is the BEST looking Aqua Car that I have seen. I was very sad that I did not have a decent camera with me. All I had was the Apple's I-Touch. The I-Touch jpeg file was less than 350kb. I was able to spruce up the photos a bit.
    Hope you will enjoy toe photos.</groundspeak:text>

When I happened upon this cache listing, I knew exactly where the cache would be.  This park is still familiar to me a bit over a decade after I left Washington for college.  I remember bicycling and walking these paths fairly often.

Things have changed a bit, naturally, but the park, for the most part, is the same as I remembered it.  Arriving at the posted coordinates, finding the cache container took but a few moments.  No one noticed as they were gathered around the lake in anticipation of upcoming fireworks.  Once signed and replaced, I snapped a few photographs to commemorate this 1500th find.  It had to be significant, and I'm glad that it was a place I remember fondly from my time in a quaint river town.  [:D]

[b][purple]Crowesfeat30[/b][/purple] &amp; I went to Washington, Mo. today with the [b][purple]L Franks[/b][/purple], we just about cleaned out the town and then Union, Mo. too! 66 caches for me &amp; Sarah, a new best day of caching. We signed the logs as SLAGA4.

We parked near the restrooms and made the walk from there. A nice quick find and some speculation of what the parks department is planning in the area. Thanks Candyce54,

I put together a route of caches that neither Bernie or I had done and it ended up bringing us out to Warrenton, down through Washington and then through Pacific before bringing us toward home on Route 100. We got around 30 caches plus or minus.  This was one of the finds.  Neat walk and a quick find.  I love this little park.  Thanks Candyce54, this was cache 9 of 33.

Oh, man, this brings back memories.  I spent my high school years in Washington, Missouri.  During that time, I must have biked every trail and road in the area at least twice.  This particular paved pathway was perfect for zooming about the park.  A few things have changed since then, though, but they seem to be for the better.  [:)]  The landscaping is definitely nice, and so was the cache!  It was found without too much difficulty and unnoticed by a family playing catch in a nearby field.  Interesting paper, too.  I signed the log and replaced everything, soaking up the festive atmosphere for the upcoming fireworks spectacular.</groundspeak:text>

Sarah &amp; I didn't stray too far from the pavilion last weekend, so we got this cache today. Fun cache, but I bet a goose would grab anything I dropped. Thanks Mwillming,

Having concluded a wonderful Father's Day, I was faced with an interesting choice.  Should I proceed home to Columbia, Missouri or look for a few geocaches whilst in the area?  This log probably indicates which won out.  [:P]  Arriving at the park, memories from high school flooded back of riding my bicycle around town and many times finding myself along the trails here.  It was just as active as I recalled if not a little more so despite the warm temperatures.  The geocache was spotted with ease but retrieval could not commence until the coast was clear, or rather, until no one was watching.  It took a few minutes for a fisherman to look away before the container could be swiped.  The log was signed with a "U!" to save space, and the geocache found itself back in place quickly.  It seemed no one was the wiser!

On the way back to the car, I was faced with another choice.  Should I continue on to the next cache or stop by a farmer selling his wares spotted on the way in?  Decisions, decisions . . .</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">(#615) After a nice, full lunch there in town today... I made my way alone over to the park and found a spot to plant my car for a few minutes. Muggles were busy picnicking and playing and frolicking all around... despite the threat of rain from the dark clouds above. None the less... I walked over to the water's edge and stared out at the fountain and the geese and the people at various spots around the lake. I intently stared at the cache's hiding place... as I used my fingers to get a better look at the details... making sure to take it in. Wouldn't want to miss any part of it and get in trouble. A couple of seconds later it was in hand as I continued to watch the water... while signing the log... and putting it all back again. It may have been busy there today... but I think everybody was pretty absorbed in their own activities... and not mine. Thanks for another cache in the area, Mwillming!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Found it pretty easily.  What a lovely and useful area!  We are impressed with Washington and love the caching to get us to so many places we wouldn't know about.  We're Snowbirds from WI and stopped in Hermann for a few days for the Wine Trail/Tin Mill Brewery and just the things to do in the area.  We saw where Washington had lots of caches and we know we won't get them all done in a day, so we'll be back another time.....possibly in the fall (Oktoberfest) on our way to AZ for the winter.

We parked in the shade, in part because I though this was going to be in a different area where I hadn't been able to find a cache about a year ago, and once we discovered it wasn't didn't want to heat the car more than necessary.  Walked over and quickly made the find.  On our way back, a muggle we had seen driving around the area for a while came up and asked what we were doing.  Told him we were geocaching  and briefly explained.  He quickly lost interest and we moved on.  Thanks for the hide.</groundspeak:text>

Some of the family thinks this activity is silly and stupid - then they go out and fish for three hours and catch a few fish if they're lucky.  This is lots more fun!!   [:D]

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Out caching with Happy Kraut on another beautiful day.  Three in a row!  I picked a great week to be off.  I put together a route of caches that neither Bernie or I had done and it ended up bringing us out to Warrenton, down through Washington and then through Pacific before bringing us toward home on Route 100. We got around 30 caches plus or minus.  This was one of the finds.  This was a nice quick park and grab. Thanks Candyce54, this was cache 8 of 33.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">As the Washington Amateur Radio Hamfest was winding down, I ran into Geocacher Jusified and did a few Geocaches. We got to see a unique rare car in operation. The car look like it just came off of the car dealers show room floor. This unique car is a AQUA CAR. You can drive the car into a lake and now it is motor Boat. This is the BEST looking Aqua Car that I have seen. I was very sad that I did not have a decent camera with me. All I had was the Apple's I-Touch. The I-Touch jpeg photo file are small, less than 350kb. I was able to spruce up the photos a bit.

Only problem was that my hand was too big to squeeze in after it.  After sticking my tongue out the corner of my mouth and letting out a few grunts I was barely able to reach it.  After I finished the string of caches in the park I headed to Sonic for a big Route 44 ice tea!!!  Man did it go down good!!!  TFTC!!</groundspeak:text>

Walking from the Grand Old Fellow cache, I garnered a few stares.  I suppose a walking stick about six feet tall doesn't exactly go unnoticed.  [:P]  Arriving at the coordinates, it seemed this would be tricky as a family was camped around there in anticipation of the night's festivities.  I politely introduced myself and why I was there.  As it turned out, they were familiar with geocaching and didn't mind my quick retrieval and signing of the log!  Very cool.  It's seems that finding other geocachers is not as uncommon as it may have once been.  With the container replaced, I was on my way back to the car - but not before grabbing a bite to eat at a nearby pavilion.</groundspeak:text>

If you are using Google maps or any other satellite map to help locate this cache please be aware that a new bridge has been built since this aerial picture was taken.  The coordinates to ground zero should be accurate now, how ever the map will deceive you!!  Good luck and Happy Caching!!

Lots of wasps around this cache and nests can be found within 20-30 feet of the cache.  If they build a nest too close, this cache, though very findable, could become unapproachable. . . maybe until cooler weather.

Acting on advice from Candyce54, I parked not too far away and began poking around the usual geocache hiding places.  Desperation was beginning to seep in as time was almost up for driving to New Haven.  It was only by spotting something a bit off out of the corner of my eye that the find was made.  Still, it's a good spot that many wouldn't look at accidentally.  [:)]  The log was signed with all due haste, and I set sights back to the road!  Sure, I may be a *tiny* bit late, but it was worth it to get out and visit a few places beforehand.</groundspeak:text>

The area is not a PASTOR (G) so be weary of ticks WARLOCKs and ROVERSCHMIDT's.  We are not trying to be SASSY(1027), but instead honor our fellow local cachers,  It is our bet that FTF honors will go to one of these caching junkies.  This cache is large enough for small item, and travel bugs; however the mechanics of this cache will not allow for heavier swag.  This cache is being started with a bracelet, glow rings, stickers, and a travel bug. Cache placed with permission of property owner. FTF honors goes to BALLERBABES!</groundspeak:long_description>

Approaching this cache at night proved a bit challenging.  The container was nevertheless soon revealed via the glow of a flashlight.  A bit of worrying was needed to obtain the cache itself.  Once figured out, it was incredibly amusing!  Well done!  I signed the log with all due flourish and returned everything as intended.  The mechanism was played with once or twice more before I continued on my way.  Hey, one must indulge their inner child every once in a while.  [;)]

Imagine coming home and getting on the computer and updating your GPS and there is a cache with your name in it.  Well we just had to go do it today, it wouldn't be right not to!  I really wish we would have been here for the rush to the cache but we were still caching in the Pomme De Terre Lake area.  

So after getting a cache in Union, driving to St Clair to fix a cache for my mom Sassy1027, also mentioned in this cache but out of the country in England, we headed to Washington for the two new caches there.

Thanks for the great cache and the mention of our name in this cache.

Thanks too for ALL the memories the above cachers have given us!

Keep caching!

I would have loved to have given Eravau a good foot race to the cache since he beat me out of a FTF for my 400th the night before :-) !    I got to this one as soon as I could today since reading the posts about the something "special" about this cache.   I was not disappointed.    Not musical, as I thought it might be, but really quite impressive.    Giving it one of my cherrished fav's!    Even with over 400 now (got 38 on Labor Day with Eravau and Sgriffin618) the new and different caches still amaze me.     SL  TFTC!   (PS, next time save a hot dog for Pastor G!).</groundspeak:text>

I've been keeping in touch with eravau since I left for England on July 16th...waiting for the big day...I knew he would make it before the end of the year...he thought I might beat him...but alas DeLorme is not used in England and even after buying the England maps..no one here can get them downloaded...DeLorme just now decided they have been sending us the wrong maps....grrr
So I'm geocaching with just a hiking arrow and no map...lol We found 174 caches so far. I checked last night late to see if eravau was any closer...we are 6 hours ahead of Missouri so he didn't have it yet.
Sorry to have missed the celebration and honored to have my name mentioned in the cache...thank you!!
Packing a picnic lunch and going to new territory to geocache the day away!! We've learned the hard way you can't just stop and get lunch here...only pubs and they don't serve food all day, we've gone home very hungry many times. We've seen some strange and funny containers here...most are homemade. Released 20 TB's here from the USA and have 14 so far to bring back with me, found one from the USA and others with missions to stay here.


Have fun everyone and thanks again.

CONGRATS to ERAVAU !!!!!!

Earlier in the evening, we had a cache watch party waiting for this cache to go live.   Ah the excitement of waiting to see who would take FTF find honors.  Had a wonderful time this with cache creators mwillming  and eravau and Ericat555 who joined us for dinner.  Then later visited with ballerbabes who stopped by.

Parking near the gate, my father and I followed a few leads on where the cache might be with little luck.  Reading the description a second time helped quite a bit and pointed out where the container might be hiding.  Bingo!  My father made the discovery and shared the find.

With the geocache back in place, we took a little time to study the gravestones in this particular cemetery.  Quite a few of them are very old; one in particular dated back to the mid-1800s with little wear!  It was granite as my father pointed out.  We stuck around for a little longer before heading back to New Haven.

Ah, Washington!  I remembered this subdivision from when I used to ride my bike through town in high school.  Thus, navigation was no problem.  Finding the geocache didn't take long, and, with a sign of the log, I proceeded back to the car.  The occupant of another vehicle waved as they passed and then parked nearby.  It was none other than Candyce54!  She was the fourth geocacher I'd bumped into since the New Year holiday began.  We talked for a little bit but had to keep it short as we both had appointments at 1.  Still, it was great to run into her, and it'll hopefully not be the last time we meet.  [:)]</groundspeak:text>

I put together a route of caches that neither Bernie or I had done and it ended up bringing us out to Warrenton, down through Washington and then through Pacific before bringing us toward home on Route 100. We got around 30 caches plus or minus.  This was one of the finds. Neat view, glad you brought me here.   Thanks Candyce54, this was cache 12 of 33.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">OCW Eravau on a VERY hot day (100+ temps).   Dragged him along for a very fun day of caching.   Last Saturday was extreme terrain (a 4/4), and this week was extreme heat!     After I dropped him off I went to get this one on my way home.   I have to confess ... a good think to do once in a while ... I had to phone him and get a hint.   My coordinates for GZ we quite a bit off from the cache, but, I soon had the cache in hand.  Fortunately I had the proper tool in the car to retrieve the log, I almost had to leave with out signning it.    Put the cache back in place in between all the traffic today.

I put together a route of caches that neither Bernie or I had done and it ended up bringing us out to Warrenton, down through Washington and then through Pacific before bringing us toward home on Route 100. We got around 30 caches plus or minus.  This was one of the finds.  We stopped and looked in several different places before we came up with the prize. Thanks Candyce54, this was cache 13 of 33.

Hard to roll paper back up than to find the actual cache.....Thanks tho, we like all kinds of caches.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">TFTC! I'm still pretty new to goegaching (this is my 17th find)... so this was my third time back at this cache with my daughter. After going on vacation last week and finding a similarly-sized cache I had a little better idea what I might need to look for here. The first two times were searches in broad daylight. And this time it only took about 15 seconds to find it... at night. And most of those 15 seconds were spent crossing the road from the parked car. Thanks again!</groundspeak:text>

I actually stopped at this one yesterday but there was a lot of activity so I decided to try again today on my way back through.  As per my usual luck.....some bicyclists decided to take a break right at the cache.  After waiting for 5 minutes in the feed store parking lot they finally went on their way.  Took a couple of scans before I located it.  Very easily overlooked. TFTC!!</groundspeak:text>

   <groundspeak:short_description html="True">The cache &lt;strong&gt;IS NOT&lt;/strong&gt; at the posted location. This is merely the best point at which to begin your journey.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
With this cache... I'm throwing you a curve - several of them actually. In order to find this cache.. you will have to take a drive of about 5 miles down a curvy country highway... taking special note of the recommended speed limits on each of the curves and the actual speed limit on the road.</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Living out in the country town of Labadie... I have ample opportunity to drive the beautiful and exciting country highways of Franklin county that curve this way and that way between hills and valleys and homes and farms. There's no way to get from here to there except to follow these roads. And if you like to drive as much as I do... then you learn to love these roads.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This particular road, Highway MM, is one that I drive from end to end... both directions... at least six times a week. I have to take this on my way to work and back... as well as many other places I go. There are farms, homes, Purina Farms, trailer parks and a couple of small businesses along the way. Depending on the time of year... there are beautiful fields full of crops or wonderfully colorful trees to be seen. There is always the possibility of catching a glimpse of hawks, turkey, vultures, raccoons, possum, owls, skunks and deer along this stretch of country highway as well... so watch where you're going.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In order to find the location of this cache... you will have to hop in your car and begin your journey at the coordinates at the top of the page in Gray Summit... and head down Highway MM until you reach the stop sign at Highway T in Labadie. Take note of the recommended speed limit on the signs warning about each of the curves or sets of curves along this beautiful stretch of road. For safety's sake... I recommend doing this as a team with one person driving and another taking the notes. These signs all have a diamond-shaped sign on top imprinted with an arrow in the approximate shape of the curves... and a rectangular-shaped sign below indicating the recommended speed at which you should take the curves (See the sample image a little further down the page). You want to make note of the speed numbers on the bottom signs. &lt;strong&gt;Write these down!&lt;/strong&gt; Make sure you get them all. You'll need them to find the cache.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Only include the signs facing you as you drive toward Labadie. None of the signs facing the other direction are taken into account... and they sometimes have different values.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/large/10b617b6-c731-4615-addc-06978199ffdb.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Once you have taken note of all the speed recommendations on the signs on this road...
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For your own sanity... the checksum of the sum of all the speeds is &lt;b&gt;9&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let &lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt; = The sum of the speeds from all of the even signs (2nd, 4th, 6th...).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let &lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt; = The sum of the speeds from all of the odd signs (1st, 3rd, 5th...).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let &lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt; = The sum of the speeds from the first three signs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let &lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt; = The sum of the speeds from the last five signs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let &lt;strong&gt;E&lt;/strong&gt; = The lowest of the advised speeds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
To find the coordinates you're looking for... use the values calculated above...
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lat:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Degrees:&lt;/em&gt; N 38°&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Minutes:&lt;/em&gt; ((A * 186) + C -4) / 1000&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lon:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Degrees:&lt;/em&gt; W 090°&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Minutes:&lt;/em&gt; ((B * 267) + D - E - 7) / 1000&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you get to these coordinates... I'm throwing you one more curve - one that isn't depicted by a big, yellow sign. You will be looking for a small, metallic tag with the rest of the information necessary for finding the actual cache container.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;NOTE: This is NOT on private residential property and permission has been granted by the business owner.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;At this point... you should be under fifteen minutes from finding the cache. After finding this penultimate point... the final shouldn't take much longer... but it &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; live up to its terrain rating. You will likely be able to complete the entire trek from beginning to final cache in less than half an hour.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A miniature &lt;i&gt;Found It&lt;/i&gt; geocoin is wired to the container and tucked slightly underneath it as an FTF prize for the first lucky finder. Have fun!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight:bold;color:#aa0000;"&gt;Congrats on FTF goes to PhilGeorge, Pastor G, BenedictJams and mwillming! It was great watching you all running around in the dark. Thanks for the patience with my error and letting me correct it for you all.&lt;/p&gt;

You could tell there was a lot of preparation that went into putting these Throw You A Curve caches together. After failing to come up with a solution on a cache at Greenfelder earlier, I suggested we go for this and its sister cache in Union since we were caching as a team of two today and these would be just downright dangerous to attempt by yourself. A nice cold day for caching from the car, since it seems like everyone is getting over the flu right now. This gets a favorite point from me, I appreciate your effort in setting up these tricky and fun caches on the always entertaining Route M and Route V, I'm waiting for you to put out one for Route T. Maybe next year???</groundspeak:text>

DirtyBeard had me check his math which was fine but his print out was missing a number (or a different number than the internet now says) which made a big difference.  We headed out today to do cache checking and some hunting and to see if I did it correctly and Yeah we scored a smiley.  Good thing I was along they don't know how to project a cord I taught myself don't know how but it works. Made DirtyBeard grab it and then he didn't have a pen so back to the car I go.  What an adventure thanks for the fun. 
 I also want to note this cache posted on the day I came down sick again and today was the first day I have done anything but work and sleep.  I am still coughing my head off but I had to get out.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I'm from Washington State (Olympia).  PastorG got me started caching this July 4th while on vacation.  So I'm back now to help out with a mutual family member who's at Mercy Hospital.  Well, we need a break, and it's Sunday night, and we figure people usually work on Mondays and aren't going to bother with a new published cache, especially a puzzle one. Well, almost right!!   Out in my area in Washington, there are about a dozen avid or rather rabid cachers that share all the FTF's so I don't bother.  They all have 5000+ finds and several FTFs among them.
But, this is Union Mo., and it should be a lot calmer. (sortof) We went for it.  We did the drive, the calculations, looked in the wrong place, received corrections from the CO, redid calculations and arrived at GZ for the "metal tag".  
I was glad the CO was there because looking for the tag at night could draw police and looking for the tag in the day could require some boldness.  We (PastorG and I) found the tag as Mwillming and Benedictjams showed up.  But none of us knew how to do projections, so we all just winged it.  With a quick tutor lesson to the CO and then to pastorG, we got closer and found it.
The terrain is definitely appropriate for this last leg.  Since I was the only one in the group without a FTF, they let me have the FTF coin.  I thank them all for it! [:)]
The geocaching gave us respite from a very trying week.  I delayed logging until Wednesday October 31st.  PastorG and I lost our loved one today at Mercy Hospital.  PastorG will be doing the service this weekend.  Thanks for the fun break in an otherwise very trying week eravau, benedictjams and mwillming!!  [:D]</groundspeak:text>

I knew that Pastor G would be on the go so I contacted mwillming and off we headed for this late night adventure.   Carefully we recorded all the required information and did the math but something was not right.   Thankfully, the CO was sitting across the street watching for us crazy FTF hounds.   Originally we thought our coords were off and we set off to drive the route again to find our error, but then the CO called to say he had made a mistake.  So we turned around and the hunt was on as Pastor G and Philgeorge1 were already there.   Well the CO certainly got some entertainment as we all stumbled around in the dark looking for the first point and then the final.   Terrain rating is definitely correct and knowledge on how to calculate a bearing very helpful.   This was a great hide.  Congrats to Philgeorge1 for taking co-honors on his first FTF.

I drove and he did the calculations.    We were pretty sure we had the right numbers, but they took us to a empty lot in a nice sub-division.    After a phone call to the CO we learned of the miscalculation and re-figured.  We knew we were close because when we drove up the final, I spotted Eravau's car lurking in the dark!    He came watched us hunt for the nasty little tag.   Once we found it we headed off for the cache, but not knowing how to work on projections on this new GPS, we were really taking a stab in the dark.   Mwilliming and Benedictjams pulled up and after fining the tag, started hunting also.    Evarau went online with someone's phone and found out how to projections on this new GPS.   We were all soon hunting in the right direction AND distance.     I discovered the cache and made the retrieval.    We all agreed to share FTF honors as this was truly a group effort.    We gave the FTF coin to Philgeorge1 because this was his FIRST FTF for him and also a great reminder of a wild night of caching in Labadie, MO!   Thanks for a fun night Eravau.</groundspeak:text>

I found (and corrected) an error in my formulas for finding the coordinates. And by the recommendation of mwillming... I'm adding a checksum to the sum of the speeds... so that people will at least know whether they're on the right track or not.</groundspeak:text>

   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Purina Farms is a great place to take the family for the afternoon or day. To me this area needed a cache, so permission was asked and granted. The Dog Jump pool area is the site of competition for dogs that are coaxed in to jumping into the water to retrive their favorite water toy. Measurments are taken and judged on distance they jump for their toy. Obviously, dogs are grouped according to size and weight for the competition. 

The Dog Jump is just one of the areas that are open to public to view while at Purina Farms.

This cache would be best visited during the day light hours, as there is a security officer at the entrance to the Farm. I personally have been here 4 times, and it was always during the daytime.  Didn't think about all you cachers out there with flashlights and lanterns hunting caches after dark. Sorry!

Open:Mid March thru  Mid November (closed major holidays) 9:30am  to 4pm

Closed: Mondays

Open: After Labor day, Wed. thru Sunday 9:30am to 4pm</groundspeak:long_description>

I drove up to the area's entrance and checked the hours.  Drat!  I had missed the window of opportunity for finding this geocache.  It seemed best to find the next cache on the GPS and see what roads needed to be taken.  While parked near the entrance, a patrol vehicle pulled alongside.  The officer inquired as to my presence, and I explained my aforementioned tardiness and plotting a new course.  He bid me good luck on the caching before driving back into the complex.  Of my encounters with officials, this was by far one of the nicest!  I'll be back to attempt this cache some day during open hours.  [:)]</groundspeak:text>

Did a good variety of cache types and containers in some neat areas.  First time I've been to the Purina Farms, and DAE hasn't been here in a long time so after doing the cache we decided to stay a while and see what's going on.  Saw the animals, petted some, and watched the dog show.  Was a lot of fun.  Thanks, Outdoors Duo!

I parked in the lot across the street from the dog running area and made my way towards ground zero. The hiding place was obvious... but there were a few people around watching the goings on... and workers playing with the dogs and doing other prep in the area. None the less... they all seemed distracted enough that after watching all that was happening for a few minutes... I made my way to the cache. I took nothing... but left my signature and one of my signature item... then put everything back where I found it. It feels a little conspicuous out here in the middle of everything... but I [b]think[/b] everyone was focused elsewhere. Thanks for a quick cache today, Outdoors Duo!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">At 10:18 this morning I received a text that the cache had been found; but that and the weather didn't dampen my spirits as I was going on a geocaching mission after work.  Little did I know how slow the day would drag on.   Finally - it was time.   I arrived at the security gate at 3 p.m. to be greeted once again with the closed sign.   Hmmmmmm.   Well after being informed by the security guard that Purina Farms is closed on Monday and Tuesdays I was a bit dismayed.   Sensing my disappointment, the guard asked what the purpose of my visit was.   I told him I was geocaching.   "Ah treasure hunting - a guy was here this morning for the same thing.  Well, you can go on in if you won't be long."   Yeah - so I headed my way to the dog show arena and scoped out the most logical location and confirmed it on my GPS.   After finding my way into the area, I easily retrieved the cache.   However, on my way back to my van I was stopped by several employees who were curious about what I was doing as they saw someone else this morning go to the exact same location.  Neither had heard of this awesome hobby so we talked a while about geocaching and then how much Purina Farms has grown in the past few years.  Thanks Outdoors Duo for another cache in the area and for some crazy fun.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False"> FTF and another smileeeeeeee!    I saw this one pop up last night and called Eravau to see if he was going for it.    He said that he was meeting some others in 5 minutes.   Well I knew I could not make it in 5, so I told him I would pass.    When I got up this morning and checked the logs .... None!!!!    When I got to work, I called Eravau at work, but he did not answer so I left a message explaining my curiosity.    I knew I could pass right by the cache in my normal routine, so I took my allotted 15 minute break and stopped in.   The security guard did look at me kind of funny when I explained what I was doing and why I was there.   However, he did let me through.   I had just started searching for the cache when Eravau returned my call and told me his story from last night.    I was *very* uncomfortable searching for it at GZ and was *very* glad when he gave me the hint so I could make a quick grab and get out.   To be honest, this cache made me even more uncomfortable than home yard caches.    Maybe with time and more geocachers coming in and out people will come to expect us.    Anyway, TFTC!

Mwillming on one shoulder saying we can sneak in, and Eravau on the other mentioning a night in jail.  Alas, the mention of a night in the big house made me decide to save this one for another time, perhaps on my way home from work tomorrow.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I was logging a previous find from today... and sitting around on Facebook when mwillming sent me a message asking about this new cache that popped up... less than 3 miles from my home... right where I pass by twice a day... 5 days a week. I noted that it was behind a gate with a guard at this hour... but after some talking back and forth... we thought we'd see if the guard was amenable to letting three cachers in for 5 or 10 minutes to help us "win" tonight. I sat across the street waiting on mwillming and benedictjams to meet me for 10 minutes or so. Once they showed up... we drove up to the guard shack at the gates. The gates were open... but the sign indicated they were closed and that we should stop there. So stop we did... and waited... and waited some more... and waited even more... but no guard showed up. After 10 or 15 minutes of hoping they'd finish whatever rounds they had to make... and would show up for us to nicely ask for a few minutes worth of admittance... we gave up, turned around and headed for home. I guess the FTF will have to go to somebody who doesn't have to work days... the only time the cache is likely available.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Caching with Web-2bs.  Enjoyed doing the tour of Labadie.  We got the values for the letters and our checksums checked, so we were confident with our coordinates.  However, we had two receivers and both zeroed part of the way up the hill, where we found nothing.  We then expanded our search and still found nothing.  After about 40 minutes we quit not knowing if our coordinates were wrong or if we just couldn't find it.  Came home and checked our solution with the coordinate checker and found our coordinates were correct, so I guess we just couldn't find it.  I have since read all the logs and conclude what we should have been looking for is a unique container that is easily overlooked.  Will contact the owner and ask for help before trying again.</groundspeak:text>

Oddly enough it looked like a park so I started walking into some woods and the property owner asked me what I was doing. I said I was very confused and was told there was a park there. Boy was that embarassing. So I left and she was eyeballing me all the way down the street. I think this is one reason a lot of people stay away from multis. Something usually goes wrong in the numbers formula and gets you in trouble on private property. I would give it a favorite point if I could get the final since I really like the town of Labadie and have been cruising through it on highway T since the day I got my first car (91 CRX). Maybe an email to the cache owners and a nudge in the right direction will lead to a smiley and a favorite point from me next time. Will definately be back. Im determined!</groundspeak:text>

After taking a good look at the old railroad bridge (circa 1910 I think), the search once again was met!  I took particular interest in investigating places not previously visited.  During this search, my sister and I were approached by a nearby fisherman wondering what was going on.  Geocaching was explained, and he thought it was a really neat idea!  After parting ways, the cache was located, and I slapped myself for missing it earlier.  Reading the previous logs really helped out.</groundspeak:text>

   <groundspeak:short_description html="False">Located in Labadie, MO. A small town that looks much like a train set. This is the first in what I hope to be a series of caches placed in towns that resemble train sets. Please park @ the Labadie Depot on Front St. Don't park at the school.</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">When I was young, I used to have a train set. I have since grown out of the hobby but still appreciate the hard work that goes into maintaining and building working scale replicas of cities and towns with trains traveling through. At one time I had the opporotunity to do a fly over of the area in a small prop plane and sure enough, this place looked JUST LIKE a train set. 

This is a simple two part multi with a tag at the posted coordinates that give the coordinates to the final stage. Have fun and I hope you enjoy my first multi stage cache in Labadie!

Greetings,

I hate to pop in here like this but from reading the last note or two on this cache, it appears that this cache is in need of repair.    When you get a chance, please stop by and do a little fixing up. If you choose to remove this cache you can archive it then.  I'm temporarily disabling it, to give you an opportunity to check on the cache

Hope things get fixed up soon.

Since it's only a couple of blocks from home... after the logged DNF a couple of days ago... I checked on the final. It appears that the train has left town on a different track than it was supposed to. If you want me to replace the final with some container I have on hand... let me know. Otherwise... I'll just wait for you to replace it with your own custom job. Thanks.</groundspeak:text>

After negotiating a bit of parking with the fire department (nice fellas, by the way), I walked to the posted coordinates and began searching.  I returned to the car twice for a flashlight and water.  It was only after investigating a bit closer that the coordinates needed were discovered.  That was indeed a devious and clever hide!  Excitedly, the second and final waypoint was approached.  Parking was negotiated in a nearby drive, and the geocache was found in fair shape.  I signed the log as best I could.  The paper resisted my pen quite heartily; so, a few nearly-identifiable scrawls were made.  I then headed back into town.  There was one more geocache left to find in Labadie, and then perhaps I'd have to consider heading back home.</groundspeak:text>

I knew it was there so I refused to give up when low and behold I found it!    First of this type that I have ever found.  The different types of caches continues to amaze me!   The final was laying out in the open so I put it back the way I assume it was intended to be.    Great cache.   Getting one of my favorites!    SL.  TFTC</groundspeak:text>

Have to give credit to "M" of the JAMS team for seeing something move.  Gotta keep those eyes on the prize.  WP1 is practically invisible but once you know it's there - it's easy to spot the difference.  After we had the new coords - we were off to add our name to the train's passenger list.  I like "fun" caches not impossible one and many times I thought this was impossible, but what a thrill.  Warlock - thanks so much for a fun ride!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">(#440) {FTF} The train arrived at the station at 5:35 p.m.! My daughter was at a friend's house and nobody else was at WP1 when I got there... so I had full concentration without any real distractions. Most of anything resembling daylight was gone... and so I had to break out the flashlight. I had looked twice in broad daylight with everything brightly highlighted and illuminated... but couldn't see a thing. But tonight after 5 minutes with some extreme Braille and careful watching with the flashlight following my fingers... I saw something that looked just a little off. I shined the flashlight right on it and pushed on it with my fingers. "Did that move?" I asked myself... trying to push down that giddiness trying to present itself... just in case it was uncalled for. I checked again. [b]It did move![/b] Now the giddiness was in full rush! I pulled it up into the light and read the strange numbered scratchings carefully as I entered them into my GPSr. Then I read them again and double-checked what I had put in the receiver... then a couple more times just to make sure. I had to make sure I knew what time the train would be at the station. I couldn't be late! I carefully replaced "the schedule" and went back to my car. I drove to the next point and looked first on the wrong side of the road... and then realized that the train station was actually on the [b]other[/b] side of the road! I walked over and looked for about a minute and a half (mostly because I kept hiding my flashlight from muggles driving by). Then my light fell on the roof to the train station... and I knew that the boarding platform must be there beneath it. I crawled under and found my train and got on board. Thanks for quite the adventure with this one, Warlock!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Drove through tonight since I thought my coords might be a little off based on logs I have seen. Using my geocaching phone app, it said I was 20 ft west when I was at true GZ., and I did however locate my tag at WP1. Would have stayed to take an updated reading with my GPS but I was being watched by a creep in a van with it's lights off so I left as soon as I verified my slight inaccuracy and located my tag. So with what I gathered from that visit, I decided to add a hint to narrow down the search area. I also don't feel comfortable sending anyone after this at night time with the neighborhood watch in full force, so I removed the "24-7" attribute and added the "stealth required" attribute. HOPEFULLY this can be found with what info I have given. I probably won't make my way back here for about a week so if any finders want to post an updated coord reading in their found log, feel free to do so.</groundspeak:text>

This is the first in what I hope to be a series of caches placed in towns that resemble train sets. Please park @ the Labadie Depot on Front St. Don't park at the school.</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">When I was young, I used to have a train set. I have since grown out of the hobby but still appreciate the hard work that goes into maintaining and building working scale replicas of cities and towns with trains traveling through. At one time I had the opporotunity to do a fly over of the area in a small prop plane and sure enough, this place looked JUST LIKE a train set. 

This is a simple two part multi with a tag at the posted coordinates that give the coordinates to the final stage. Have fun and I hope you enjoy my first multi stage cache in Labadie!

   <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This small cache is placed at the beginning of the road that
leaves the town of Labadie and leads to the power plant just
outside of Labadie. The plant is the only &lt;strong&gt;major&lt;/strong&gt;
industry out in this little town besides farming. The cache is on
public property about a mile from the gates of the power plant, but
if you so choose, you could continue down the road toward the
gates. But you would still be quite far from the facility
itself.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;As a resident of the area, I've been wanting to get more caches
out this way. And this is my first step towards that goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an unregistered Geojelly geocoin as a first to find
prize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have fun visiting our small town. And if you haven't searched
for it yet, get the &lt;a href=
"http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=23b838e2-865c-4f8b-b369-64279d35580b"&gt;

little about the place in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

Look for a 3" diameter by 1.5" Lock-N-Lock under the bridge at the north end on the east side west of the second beam running the length of the bridge.  Just go under the bridge at the bridge at the northeast corner and it will be in plain sight.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Took an AWESOME drive down my favorite highway, HWY T, in my new toy. This is my first time on HWY T in my near perfect 2002 Z28 Camaro Convertible with the top down. Turned off the radio and listened to 320 horses sing through the Borla exhaust while hugging the curves. Yeah it was 40 degrees but I couldn't help myself. This is the only cache I got today but it was fun. Snapped a few pics of my LS1 powered hot rod next to the bridge of power. Thanks eravau for placing this neat cache in my favorite "train set" town. I've always loved this area ever since I got my first car (1991 Honda CRX) and did my first solo roadtrips through Franklin and Gasconade counties when I was a teenager. PLEASE keep placing caches along this route to give me and more cachers a reason to keep cruising through the area!!!

Sizzling could be heard high above as rain struck the power lines.  Something about ionized particles floated lazily to the top of my brain only to be shrugged off in lieu of looking for the cache.  A truck pulled up soon afterwards with the AmerenUE insignia.  I was asked if what I was doing was for said company.  After an honest reply and a brief explanation, I was allowed to continue on my way.  It was only after taking a quick look at the hint that the container was discovered in the darkness.  Good spot!  With a little luck, little will disturb the hide.  [;)]  With a sign of the pen, I continued on my journey to see what else could be found on this increasingly chilly caching evening.

   <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;The first cache I placed here in Labadie calls attention to the largest single employer here in town - the power plant. But this cache calls attention to all of the independently self-employed people that make up the other &lt;strong&gt;huge&lt;/strong&gt; industry here in Labadie - farming.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/large/db9cf704-a05a-488c-b38c-e7405eda6371.jpg" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;small&gt;&lt;i&gt;view from the cache&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've lived here in Labadie for almost nine years and have fallen in love with this town... from the people who have lived and worked here from the day they were born to the transplants trying to escape the city. I grew up in a similarly-sized tiny town in Indiana and feel like I'm where I belong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started caching in the summer of 2011... there was only one cache in town to draw people here. Since I thought more people should have an excuse to enjoy our peaceful town and the drive out here... I've placed a couple of caches... and one like-minded cacher has placed another here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache itself is on fairly flat ground on public right of way at the intersection of two gravel roads in the middle of some fields. There's nothing around the cache for about a half a mile that could hide you from view... so you'll have to watch out for muggles... which are fairly infrequent, but not completely absent out here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The find should be quick... and might even be wheelchair accessible if you are a little bit flexible. This cache isn't so much about the difficulty of the hunt... but the view on the drive out here and the enjoyment of getting away from the hustle and bustle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoy your visit.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

There's nothing like a straight forward cache to ease the mind after a very difficult one!  I parked along the road and signed the log dutifully.  A few photographs were taken, and I returned to the car to contemplate my next move.  Sure, I could head back home, but there were still a few more caches to find in Franklin County.

Finding the road to this cache at night proved to be a bit more difficult than anticipated.  Still, the correct entry was eventually discovered and followed.  Finding the container at night proved no problem.  I signed the log as is usual for this sort of activity and replaced the container as discovered.  The car was turned around and the next cache on the list pursued with all due haste.  After all, there was still the drive back to Columbia to consider.  [;)]

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">(#992) Out caching alone on my way home from work this evening. I had been 0 for 3 on my hunts today... and was hoping this one... only about a mile from home... would pull me out of today's rut. When I saw this one come out a month ago... I was at work... and so wasn't close enough to get FTF before anyone else. So I decided to put this one off when I needed an emergency find... like today.

So when I was almost home... I pulled in here to the housing division. Unfortunately... I hadn't updated the cache info in my GPS since a couple of days after it came out... so I was searching over near the entrance by Highway T. I spent a good 10 or 15 minutes looking around this area before deciding I should call a friend for some help. He told me where it had been when he found it... a place I had already checked... but checked again. Needless to say... I didn't find it.

And a minute after I had pretty much given up looking at the old hiding places... my phoned friend noticed something and told me [b]why[/b] I wasn't finding it. The coordinates had been updated since I had loaded them in my GPS. So he gave me the new coordinates... 4/10 of a mile away from the previous location. I drove down the road to about 100 feet from where the GPS read ground zero and parked.

Then my hunt began anew... a "small" cache container somewhere in the area. And hunt I did. The coordinates put me in the middle of a dirt driveway 20 feet from anything. But the closest "anything" to zero was very prickly and thorny. But that's never stopped me before... so I didn't let it today. I searched the painfully thorny area back and forth and 'round and 'round for over 10 minutes in all the places I thought something could possibly be hiding before getting frustrated and ready to give up.

Then I spied a similar area on the other side of the street... and decided that it couldn't hurt to at least check it out before I left the area for good. And as soon as I walked across the street... the cache was obvious and immediately in my hand. If there weren't so few places to hide things in the area... there's no way I ever would have found this... with my GPS reading over 75 feet from ground zero where I found the cache. I pulled out the soaking wet log and gently signed it so as not to tear it up. I don't think the lid is watertight... and the log probably needs dried out or replaced... and housed in a ziplock bag inside of the container.

I didn't take anything from the cache.... but left my signature and my signature item. I took a 150+ ping average of the coordinates that should get hunters quite a bit closer to the actual cache and am posting them with my log here. Thanks for the hunt, DacktylPak! It's great to see some new caches "in my neighborhood."</groundspeak:text>

After thinking that their was too much PI and painful thorns we reread logs and noted that BOD had placed the GZ a bit to the west.  THEN we found the container.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Hard fought DNF. Spent a good 20 minutes before giving up. Coords zeroed out in the dead center of the road entering the neighborhood. From there I picked apart the rock piles, bushes, signs and surrounding trees and still couldn't locate it. I did however find a very active wasp's nest in a bush on the west side of the entrance in the middle bush so I didn't want to spend too long in those bushes searching. Having it been almost a year since my first wasp sting (@ an electrical box hide when caching in urban Portland, OR) I didn't wanna make an annual event of it by getting stung this time. Head hung in shame over a DNF on a 1.5/1.5 Pn'G, I drove on and got "Outstanding in His Field" in nearby Labadie to redeem a find for my 7/29 calendar date. Thanks anyway for placing the cache, I will be back in the area again and hopefully find this next time.</groundspeak:text>

Since your new cache seems to have all the required parts, not closer than 0.1 mile from any other caches, not near a railway and you are close enough to properly maintain it, it has been listed on the GC.com site . One of the things that cachers with small kids, pregnant cachers and one guy here with a brace on his leg seem to like, is a note about the approximate distance or about how much time the cache might take. (just a thought for next time) . 

[green] [B]By submitting a cache listing, you assure us that you have adequate permission to hide your cache in the selected location. However, if we see a cache description that mentions ignoring "No Trespassing" signs (or any other obvious issues), your listing may be immediately archived. We also assume that your cache placement complies with all applicable laws. If an obvious legal issue is present, or is brought to our attention, your listing may be immediately archived..[/green][/B]

What a fun day! I am currently out on an epic, two-day caching extravaganza and had a blast today. The day began early with some vehicle mechanical issues, but with some quick fixing, I was back on the road. Today, while on a route from Fulton to St. Louis and then to Cuba, I have found a lot of park and grabs and even hiked 6.7 miles with a great bunch of SLAGA people on Howell Island, picking up twelve new caches. One was even a FTF...my first in St. Louis! [:D]

TNLN/SL This was the 33rd of 62 total caches found today. Thanks, groundfind, for placing this cache and for the fun!

Many a time I've passed this cache up due to a post-sunset arrival in Pacific.  I was determined after clearing out Labadie to arrive before the inevitable twilight and raced to the coordinates.  There was plenty of light left when I arrived.  Walking to the coordinates, a police vehicle was noticed and vice versa.  The officer inside must have decided I wasn't all that interesting before driving back towards downtown.  Finding the cache occurred soon thereafter, and the log was signed.  The next course was plotted to a nearby bridge.  Hopefully, I wasn't pushing myself too far this evening.

Container is broken and cover doesn't fit tightly on, I set it back on and tried to put cache back in a way it would keep it together.  May need to replace this container.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Out caching with Happy Kraut on another beautiful day.  Three in a row!  I picked a great week to be off.  I put together a route of caches that neither Bernie or I had done and it ended up bringing us out to Warrenton, down through Washington and then through Pacific before bringing us toward home on Route 100. We got around 30 caches plus or minus.  This was one of the finds. We didn't break any rules finding this cache and made quick work of it.   Thanks groundfind, this was cache 20 of 33.

What a fun day! I am currently out on an epic, two-day caching extravaganza and had a blast today. The day began early with some vehicle mechanical issues, but with some quick fixing, I was back on the road. Today, while on a route from Fulton to St. Louis and then to Cuba, I have found a lot of park and grabs and even hiked 6.7 miles with a great bunch of SLAGA people on Howell Island, picking up twelve new caches. One was even a FTF...my first in St. Louis! [:D]

TNLN/SL This was the 35th of 62 total caches found today. Thanks, tinapoison, for placing this cache and for the fun!

We wondered about this one for a minute, but quickly got it once we got out of the car. Thanks tinapoison, this was the 26th and last cache of the day.

I parked a bit down the road and hoofed it to this cache to avoid suspicion.  A number of people were gathering at the local video store, and the less I did to call attention to my activities, the better.  Arriving at the coordinates brought forth a bit of regret for leaving the flashlight in the car.  However, despite this setback, the container was discovered following a hunch a bit of geocaching experience provided.  Very nice!  The log was signed in short order, and then I was back on the road to further adventure!</groundspeak:text>

I put together a route of caches that neither Bernie or I had done and it ended up bringing us out to Warrenton, down through Washington and then through Pacific before bringing us toward home on Route 100. We got around 30 caches plus or minus.  This was one of the finds. A nice quick find. We took a bit of time to see some of the flowers that were available.  Thanks tinapoison, this was cache 19 of 33.

walked up the stairs from lower parking lot and started looking around. Then saw the work geocaching on the ground on a piece of paper. It was attached to a rope while said Geocachers, nothing behind rope, or something of that sort....It was all shuffled together on the ground so it only confused me.... Luckily a man walked up and asked if we could find it! We hadn't really started looking, be he explained the rope situation, that he didn't want anyone messing with his plants in his shop, which is very understandable. He was a very nice guy! He began to explain that it was a pretty difficult find! But before the words were out of his mouth I had the cache in my hand!! I really like this one!!
thank you tina for hiding this one!! very clever!!</groundspeak:text>

I know that trips to the tack shop only happen if we find at least one geocache while in the area. Nan-d1955 had this one in the gps just waiting for the next time I wanted to head west.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">LAFing Bird wanted to make a trip to the tack shop to look at bits for her horse.  She knows that trip to the tack shop only happens if we find at least one geocache in the area.  I have had this one in the gps just waiting for the next time she wanted to head west.  Good thing she was along because this cache utilized one her strong points in finding caches.  TFTC</groundspeak:text>

I looked at the map and saw it was [b]just[/b] off the road... so I took off on a 20 minute drive to GZ to hunt. After parking on the side street's shoulder... I headed toward the bridge... flashlight in hand. GZ put me at a scruffy little bush with hardly anywhere to hide anything... but I looked. Then I expanded my search in ever-widening circles for the next 30 minutes... unsuccessfully. I'm not sure where the cache is... but if it's a micro under one of the rocks that I didn't happen to turn over... then this is a serious "needle in a haystack" set-up. I only hope it's not... and that I get back soon in daylight to find it. Thanks for the late-nightadventure, Dime-osaur!</groundspeak:text>

   <groundspeak:short_description html="True">We've been geocaching for 10 years and are finally placing our 1st cache. My son, who was 6 years old when we started, always wanted to place a cache called Easy Peasy Lemon Squeezy. So finally 10 years later, even though he's not a little boy anymore, here it is. A new paved trail just opened in Eureka connecting Kircher Park (adjacent to Route 66 State Park) and Lions Park. We felt this was a good place to hide a cache to bring people to this newly completed trail.</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Cache container is a small lock and lock container. Small items may be placed in the cache. This definately is Easy Peasy Lemon Squeezy.

Thought I would place a second cache in this park since it's such a beautiful park to share with others. You can reach this cache by parking at either the Forest Shelter parking lot or the Dog Wood Shelter parking lot. If you prefer no bushwacking, and no little critters crawling around on you, you could choose to follow the path which runs down between these two shelters. The path takes you down to the river, at this point you should turn towards the left and follow your GPS. Otherwise park and follow your GPS and enjoy the trek. 

Please unscrew center area of hook to open hook off of location. Please replace cache in original position/area, in the same manner. Cache contains log book only, so don't forget your pencil. 

This cache was placed with the specific permission of the Missouri Department of Natural Resources.

NOTICE: Please be respectful of the posted park hours. If you enter the park after hours you are trespassing. If you are stopped you can be ticketed or arrested and will put the future of geocaching in the parks in jeopardy.

I'd never been there before, right as we were parking we saw about 7 deer (about 3 moms and 4 babies)  They were right at the edge of the parking lot looking right at us.  Then when we were later on the trail we saw about 4 more.  We were able to get within about 50 feet of the deer with out them being too spooked! Anyway, great hide! Here's a tip, stay on the trail!!!!!!!! The iPhone app took us on what seemed like a 7 mile hike through waist high thorn bushes! :( lol  Continue down the gravel path till you see a grassy (mowed) path to your left. Then proceed ahead! lol</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Greetings fellow geocacher, 

Looks like this cache has been temporarily disabled for a while now While I feel that Geocaching.com should hold the location for you and block other caches from entering the area around this cache for a reasonable amount of time, we can't do so forever.

Please either repair/replace this cache, or archive it (using the [i]archive listing[/i] link in the upper right) so that someone else can place a cache in the area, and geocachers can once again enjoy visiting this location.

If you plan on repairing this cache, please [b]log a note to the cache[/b] (not email) so I don't archive the listing for non-communication. Once you have made the repairs make sure you enable the cache again by writing an owners note. If the [b][red]"Needs Maintenance"[/b][/red] attribute  is showing you will need to also write a [b][green]"Owners Maintenance"[/b][/green]  note to remove it. http://tinyurl.com/yezjvyt

[b][RED]If not repaired, this one is scheduled to be archived next month on my next check of disabled caches.[/b][/RED]

I want to thank you for the time that you have taken to contribute to Geocaching in the past and I am looking forward to seeing your cache up and running in the near future. 

Hope this gets fixed up soon,

Denmother and I went for this one before we head down to Washington MO.  On our way to the cache we came across a corn snake coiled in the grass.  We did not have our camera to get a picture, but we watched it for awhile and then left him be and went for the cache.  We found the "nest" with the log inside.   Thanks, kbd691, for the cache.

Great day for our first ride this year and first after a two-year span of no riding.  It has been 4 months, 24 days since we hunted for our last cache.  I guess I am coming back after geocaching burnout #4.  Found the remains of an old geocaching logbook on the path.

Ken teased me about bushwhacking to this site after my earlier complaints - but this one was nice and FLAT!!!!  Found the container quickly, but had a little trouble finding the log.

The World Bird Sanctuary is next door to Lone Elk County Park and Chubb Trail, and are open daily from 8am - 5pm. The World Bird Sanctuary features free seasonal shows, nature trails, educational programs and picnic pavilions. They have free entry and parking.
They also have live displays featuring Bald Eagles, Owls, Hawks, Falcons, Vultures, Parrots, Reptiles and much more!

Plenty of muggles around but I was able to hide the container as I grabbed the tree to hold on and creak my down to the ground for a sit, being somewhat of an old-timer.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">It's been years since we've been here, and planned to just grab the WhereIGo. This 'little' park has blossomed in the past few years. I remember when there were only two Eagle Cages (and those were new) in the back. Found beautiful picnic area to fuel up the kids before our adventure. Husband even got to take part in the Bird Encounters that they have in the afternoon. 

Found this cache, and snagged it in between the WereIGo travels. This is a little more challenging than it looks (especially on a nice Sunday afternoon), as you have to keep and eye out for muggles in the area. Did run across javapgmr in the park. He was on his own caching mission.

I do enjoy these caches. Thanks for hiding and for the WhereIGo.</groundspeak:text>

I hadn't been to west county lately had wanted to grab a number that have accumulated in Lone Elk and Lower Buder park.  This was one of the caches I found.  I managed to find all but one cache. I love this area and met another cacher doing the local WhereIGo as I walked toward the cache.  This was a quick find.  TNLNSL. TFTC.

Thank you to all the people out there who have hidden and will continue to hide geocaches on all seven continents, in the oceans and even outer space. Please yield caution as the cache is on a rocky cliff bottom and falling rocks due to erosion are common, especially after rain/snow. Special thanks to Reviewer, Banjo Boy, for attempting the difficult task of making this the 2,000,000th cache, but 2,000,181 isn't bad (see "Reviewer Note").

Traveling home presented the perfect opportunity to visit a cache that had been passed a day prior.  That, and there were several travel bugs in need of a new home.  [;)]  Parking was found easily, and I crossed the road with care.  There were a few good spots that cried out, "Geocache!"  However, only one was true and revealed a container that had a bit of a squeeze.  Repairs were made as best as possible.  With a few swipes of a pen, the cache was claimed as found.  Bugs were deposited, and I was soon on my way back home.

It had rained a good bit lately and with water still running between the cracks in the rocks was a bit leery about the possibility of falling rocks.   The coords were good, but we still did a good bit of searching.  Finally IBEW Ret found it where both of us had previously searched.  The container was well anchored, but he was able to get the lid off to access the log.  Thanks WARLOCK!

I tried for the 2,000,000th cache published, but late last night it was still several 100 short so I checked early this morning and the 2,000,000th had already been published, so went back to bed. You're still the 2,000,181st though.

Well.... don't feel too bad. I miss it twice before I spotted it. I will give you a hint. If you are short, this may make it more difficult to get to it.    good luck.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">(#1,190) As I was walking out of the wood from finding the cache on a steep hillside on the other side3 of the park... I ran into a park ranger and had a nice conversation. He had seen my lone car in the lot and feared I was one of the mischievous, local teenagers there to destroy property or participate in other unsanctioned activities. But seeing my age and the GPS hanging around my neck... he immediately knew what I was up to. He told me how he's gotten called to check on weird people wandering around in the woods in some of the St. Louis parks (especially in Laumeier Sculpture Park)... and has come to know quite a bit about geocaching.

After that... I walked along the edge of the trees... all the way 'til I got to the other pavilion... quite a ways from the parking lot. With no one else in the park... there were no muggles to worry about as I searched the area that the GPS called ground zero. I spent a lot of time hunting in the typical hiding places in this kind of environment. I spent [b]way[/b] more time than I should have... if only I'd read the cache description a little more carefully.

After exhausting all of the typical hiding places... and even a couple that I thought would have been ingenious hides... I finally gave up and looked at the description again... and decided to follow its guidance. Once I did... it was less than 5 minutes before I saw the cache... and a minute or so later that I had it in hand.

My tweezers came in handy for log removal... and my signature was soon added to the list of those that had come before. Thanks for the challenge this evening, Evshro &amp; son!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">After a busy day and a brief rest, I went out for a brief caching run. The park was somewhat crowded so I was concerned that the cache location would be muggly.  But it was completely empty, so I could search carefully.  It took me a few minutes to find an odd piece of something sticking out that I pulled.  I had it.  Plus, it was so nice to sit quietly and sign the log before putting it back.

Sunlight filtered through the clouds as I walked across the cut grass from the west parking.  It was definitely a nice day to cache as a cool breeze blew through the trees and relieved the heat from earlier.  Finding this particular container proved to be an interesting challenge as several places seemed to all call out in vain.  It was noticing one particular detail that brought forth a log to sign.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Well, I went by and found the Magnetic Key cache which was about 30+ feet away from the actual cache.  I was shocked too see that only 4 people actually found the correct cache.  Kudos to JP Billy, RGS, The Mad Chef, and xx75vulcan.  Everyone else (30+ cachers logged an incorrect cache).  Anyway, it looks like Cacher Check found the key case first and labeled it for the first TT #3, and from there the other cachers got confused.  Feel free to go out and find the correct one.  It is a Tube-like cache just like the rest of them and should be a little more challenging.  At least this explains the coordinates being off.</groundspeak:text>

So about 7 tonight and armed with a flashlight I tried again. This time I was searching a different area than before and spotted it with the flashlight. A little more work and I had it. I agree with JP Billy though, the coords seem to be off although I didn't take a new reading.

   <groundspeak:short_description html="True">The cache should be easy to find and get to.  WP1 is located at a local food pantry andis a little over 1 mile away from the final.  I would recommend driving to the final and avoiding the swim so the driving route will be longer.</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Chrysler had two plants in Fenton, a North and a South.  The south plant opened in 1959 and the North plant opened in 1966.  Both plants are now shut down and torn down.  At WP1 you will probably see the last thing that remains from the factory. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
     The North Plant started out making B series vans and wagons then switched to the Ram Truck in 1980.  Over 1 million trucks were built.  This factory closed its doors on July 10 2009.  The production was moved to Saltillo, Mexico and Warren, Michigan.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The North Plant opened 1966.  Here is a list of the vehicles made in the North Plant.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Valiant, Lancer, Dart, Belvedere, Monaco, Coronet, Barracuda, Charger, Volare, Aspen, Le Barron, Diplomat coup, Caravelle coup, Aries, Reliant, Limousine, Executive, Laser, Daytona, and Minivans.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The plant closed October 31 2008 and production was moved to Windsor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To find this final you will need to find a monument at WP1. find a 4 digit # on the monument. The first digit is A. The third digit is B. C=A+B. The final is at N38 32.(C*A)A(C*A+A) W 090 27.(C*C)(C*C)(C+A) Have Fun.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">(#1,151) Out caching for a little while this evening with Pastor G. Calculating the coordinates at waypoint 1 was fast and easy (but I still managed to multiply the wrong numbers together the first time and had to correct myself). Once we knew where the final was located... it became obvious that a couple of other caches would need to be grabbed on the way. So we grabbed the caboose nearby WP1... and then took a wrong turn and Pastor G grabbed one in Buder Park that I had gotten a few months ago. After that... we made our way down the road to the final. We parked about 15 feet from GZ and both walked over. I was coming from one side... and Pastor G from the other. He had the right one and made the grab. Took nothing but some pictures... left my signature and one of my signature items. Thanks for a nice multi, stewy1966! The final was indeed a great view.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I really enjoyed this one and a really great view too! I remember way back when the Chrysler plant was still in full operation. It was very sad when they tore it down. I was able to come up with the right numbers very quickly today since I was already by here. After grabbing a couple other caches en route I was able to quickly grab this one. Thanks for another very fun cache Steve!</groundspeak:text>

We ended up spending half the day w them and they let us use their canoe to get to a couple of them. They have 2 little ones that are pretty good on the water in the canoe themselves! It was fun watching them.  

We ran out of time to make the grab Saturday. We had to get back home to tend to our dog. Decided to find this one as our cache of the day before a company picnic that we need to attend. Thanks Stewy66, glad we didn't have to walk or canoe to the final [;)]. My arms are sore from yesterday's trek on the Meramec.</groundspeak:text>

But in between I grabbed a few cache before going after the final. I had a good idea where it was and the coords were right on far a quick and easy find.

   <groundspeak:short_description html="True">The cache should be easy to find and get to.  WP1 is located at a local food pantry andis a little over 1 mile away from the final.  I would recommend driving to the final and avoiding the swim so the driving route will be longer.</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Chrysler had two plants in Fenton, a North and a South.  The south plant opened in 1959 and the North plant opened in 1966.  Both plants are now shut down and torn down.  At WP1 you will probably see the last thing that remains from the factory. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
     The North Plant started out making B series vans and wagons then switched to the Ram Truck in 1980.  Over 1 million trucks were built.  This factory closed its doors on July 10 2009.  The production was moved to Saltillo, Mexico and Warren, Michigan.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The North Plant opened 1966.  Here is a list of the vehicles made in the North Plant.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Valiant, Lancer, Dart, Belvedere, Monaco, Coronet, Barracuda, Charger, Volare, Aspen, Le Barron, Diplomat coup, Caravelle coup, Aries, Reliant, Limousine, Executive, Laser, Daytona, and Minivans.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The plant closed October 31 2008 and production was moved to Windsor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To find this final you will need to find a monument at WP1. find a 4 digit # on the monument. The first digit is A. The third digit is B. C=A+B. The final is at N38 32.(C*A)A(C*A+A) W 090 27.(C*C)(C*C)(C+A) Have Fun.</groundspeak:long_description>

We continued standing by the cache (and NOT looking) for another 10 minutes, simply because we were engrossed in our conversion.  When we finally reached a lull, I decided to announce, "By the way, I found the geocache".  Woodcacher gave me a puzzled look since neither one of us had been looking, then she set about to find the cache herself.  A few minutes later we both had found and logged the cache.

While in Lake Charles had a chance to go fishing in a pirogue on the bayou.
  
Thanks, Forest-Ghost, for the hide and good memories

Well the cache went missing. That is okay though, as although it was very special cajun wood, we all now that swamp wood is not "good wood." In the words of me ol grand daddy, "Cajun wood is only good for two things: hunting gators and eatin em."

I will come back out soon and see if I can't track it down the original container. Until then I moved the coordinates a little and added some extra cammo to what is a very similar hide as the original. Hopefully this will last a little longer. There is now a BMX course very near gz of this cache so it is possible the cache was muggled while that was being put together.</groundspeak:text>

The weather had cooled down after the rain so it was a nice time to be out in the woods. I left the GPS at home and was using my iphone which ended up being not very helpful. I eventually put it away and started to use instinct. I spotted a little friend near GZ which had me searching in other spots but I eventually came back and found it. WOW!!! This container was so cool, have not seen another cache like this yet. Definitely gets a favorite point from me. I love the cammo job.

I headed where the car lead and ended up going through Unger Park, Buder Park, Lone Elk Park, Valley Park [:)], Simpson Park and part of the Merrimac Greenway.  I didn't find a great deal of caches, but I had a great time at each.  There were some tough ones in the batch that I found today.

Great hide.  I looked up and down and then down and up before finally finding the necessary angle to see the cache.  I think it's stable and will stay where you put it.  I love this hide.  Looking forward to finding some of the other of this type.

This was find number 5 of 8 that I grabbed today.

Given prior success, I was sure this would be a quick and easy find.  Nope!  The GPS lead me around in many circles in many different places.  The tree cover must have been messing with the signal.  Nevertheless, I tired of the run around and began looking without.  This proved even more difficult as there were many, many likely spots.  It was only when I was just about ready to call it that something appeared out of the corner of my eye.  Surely not . . .

Seeing a spider in the cache container startled the both of us as I cautiously obtained the log and signed.  Everything was placed back as found (including the spider - sorry!), and I was soon trying to find my way out of the wood.

I think with the cache being virtually indestructible that it'll stay in its place. In theory you might be able to get a boat to the cache. At this point, I have never seen the river this high.

The river is up and I bet it will continue to rise.  After doing a couple, I ran into Quailman2 and spent the rest of the day caching with them and had a great time doing some nice cahces.  Thanks.

Glad I had my map with the corrections of all the roads and trails.  This one is going to be much harder in the summer.  I also would suggest not hunting for this one when the wind is blowing.  Its called a "widow maker"

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">We got to the site after a nice walk from the parking area on the levee in Vally Park. We didt find the cache right away but it didn't take us very  long. As soon as we got in the area I know where I was.  I could see many people here. Lots of children working as well as older people. Sounds of work, smells of smelting ovens cooking up new sheets of high  quality glass. Looks like everyone was from the turn of the century, my guess is 1900 to maybe 1915 or so. The workers were all busy and didn't seem to mind that we were in their area. In fact, they didn't seem to notice us at all. This place is huge here. After a few minutes the shadowy images became clear. We are in an old glass factory! Right here in the woods. Funny place to have a factory.   

I got to talking to an old guy that said his name was Thomas J. Rogers, foreman of the potroom at the factory. He got to talking and told me that The St. Louis Plate Glass Company incorporated and established its plant in Valley Park in 1902. And that is where we were now. The capital invested amounts to $1,500,000. The plant occupies twenty acres ground space, seven acres being used in the plate glass manufacture, except such space as is needed for offices, store rooms, etc. The average number of men employed is 500, many of them skilled workmen. The Capacity is 225,000 square feet of finished product per month. The pay roll amounts to $25,000 per month. The output is estimated at $900,000 per annum. The product is of such superior quality and finish that it competes successfully with the most reputable glass works of Europe and America. It is marketed in Chicago, and west of the Mississippi River in St. Louis, Denver, San Francisco and other cities.   

I turned around to put the log back and when I looked back to Mr. Rodgers, he was gone. The workers were gone, the sounds were gone except for the birds and leaves.    This is one strange and Interesting place here here. Found at 1:50 PM</groundspeak:text>

I was driving to the parking area, not far from the geocache when I had to completely stop my vehicle and then back up.  Why?  Because a black rat snake was slowly slithering its way across the road where I was driving.   Hmm.  I wonder if it was the same one described on the cache page.

We found the cache in short order. But we must have still been thinking about the snake because we both jumped when the cache container popped out.  That gave us both a good, sheepish laugh at ourselves.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">After attending the nearby CITO event, I decided to hit the trail and get a few caches. The river was really high and was even higher by the time I was done. I stopped at this one first and could not find the cache and just assumed it was under water, but later on my way back to the car I noticed something had been moved but the water had gone up and I had to straddle a log to get the cache which was now halfway under water. The good news is that the inside was dry, hopefully the seal will keep it that way because I am sure it will be completely under soon if it is not already.

Woodcacher11 and I looked for 20 before I broke down and made a PAF to the CO.  And (of course) no sooner had I made the call did woodcacher actually make the find all on her own.   [:)]  So it goes.

There is a new park entrance near where Pyramid Drive used to end to the east.  You can drive to within 500 feet of the cache.  The cache is a red bison in crevice of interior north wall behind a rock at knee level or slightly above.

Which also happens to be the first place that I looked and I'm sure I looked there at least 3 times. Blame it on age.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Ok, I looked for this one a short time Friday evening, but I stirred something up that I'm allergic to and couldn't stop sneezing. So I came back this evening, took some claritin and dived in with my dog and plenty of time. Apparently I suck at finding the "easy" ones. I just don't see it. I took a break and walked up the trail to find Just a Preform Along the Trail. I stopped on my way back for a fresh look, still nada. I'm missing something, and its gonna drive me crazy. And I guess dogs aren't bred with geocache hunting skills either because mine does not like to leave the nice paved trail. 
It got me off the couch and out of the house. I got some good exercise and I logged 2 more along the trail so all is not lost. I might return tomorrow with 4 more eyeballs to help.</groundspeak:text>

Logic dictated quite clearly that I should be heading home instead of geocaching.  But where's the fun in that?  [:P]  I found a suitable place to park near the archery range and walked to the paved trail.  Seeing where the GPS pointed from there, I sighed heavily.  This was going to be a difficult bushwhack!  The weeds were indeed tall, and reaching the coordinates took a little doing.  Still, the stop was rewarded with quite an interesting structure!  A bit of thinking brought forth the cache in a seemingly unlikely place.  Well done!  A fresh log was signed, and I made out of there as best I could.</groundspeak:text>

I really like this spot and this structure.  Qualman2 found it.  I would strongly suggest you redo this cache or it is going to float away the next time it floods.  It needs to be attached to something.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Got out today to explore the newly completed bike trail and GPS the stuff that changed in the park.  Got in a nice ride and found 5 caches.  Had a great time finding 5 well done caches in nice areas.  However, I did not find this one.  I found the box and searched all the nooks and crannies with my flashlight.  Then I thought about how close I was to the river and figured if it was where I was looking, it would float away in the next flood.  So still inside the box I looked up for a place a cahce could be attached so it does not float away and had no luck.  I would have looked longer but it was hot and the sweat was pouring in my eyes.  So I got back on my bike and went on.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Yep, 'I was here' today finishing what I started earlier in the week.   When I started teaching in Valley Park, 24 years ago, there were houses where this trail is constructed.  The driveways to nowhere prove that.  I can't say for sure that I had any students that lived on this street, but it sure might be possible.  I can say that I remember driving down River Drive in years past.  At the time I didn't realize how close to the Meramec those houses were built.  It's no wonder some of those families were displaced in the spring floods.  But many would return once the water receded.  From the path, one doesn't realize that that structure is back there in the tall grass.  Great place to hide a cache.  The coords were pretty much dead on, but I can see how some geocachers would have been scratching their heads while looking for this one.  TNLNSL  TFTC</groundspeak:text>

This cache was the closest to my home I haven't found, I had the original coords in my GPSr when I was looking for this cache. It had me down by the river and something that almost matched the hint except it was way off the trail. Did quit a bit of looking in all the wrong places. On the way back to the trail gave the last place that matched the hint and finally found it about 115 ft off the original coords. It wasn't fun looking around. I kept saying to myself this is not a *&amp;%*&amp;%&amp;$ 1.5/1.5 hide.

Access to the park is east of the floodgate.  You can leave the
blacktop road and park due east of the cache but access the woods from
the trail (south) side.  The cache is close to the north edge of the
woods but there is a deep ravine to negotiate.  It is a 6” by 6” by 2”

I'm going to have to start paying more attention to the map so that I don't have to find creative ways to cross the river.  I left a kids meal toy and a track.  If the next cacher would bring with them a large zip lock baggie to replace the outside one, that might not be a bad idea.  Contents was dry just a little musty. 
Nice park.  The city should use the old train supports to make a path connecting both sides.

But as I scoped out the area, I found a fairly easy route to the cache.  As I write this log, I'm now relaxing on one of the nice, convenient benches along the trail.
Thanks for a lovely walk and for the cache.

I left the trail and wound my way through a depression (noting and avoiding spiders whenever possible).  A quick climb revealed a raised levee-like area with quite a bit of debris.  Searching diligently began but only ceased when the GPS was ignored.  Geo-sense prevailed and revealed the true hiding place for the cache, and a good one at that!  I signed the log in a bit of a haste as I dared to think it possible to nab as many caches along this trail as possible before the sun set.  [:)]

This one is between the levee and the river so it needs to be flood proofed.  I would strongly suggest you tie this cache to a tree so it does not float away in a flood.  I learned the hard way!

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Congratulations, 

Since your new cache seems to have all the required parts, not closer than 0.1 mile from any other caches, not near a railway and you are close enough to properly maintain it, it has been listed on the GC.com site . One of the things that cachers with small kids, pregnant cachers and one guy here with a brace on his leg seem to like, is a note about the approximate distance or about how much time the cache might take. (just a thought for next time) . 

  Looks fun,  Enjoy!
   
Cheers &amp; Thanks for your contributions to Geocaching,

After thinking ab;out it for a while I figured the cache had to be placed there by Superman. Superman has been having problems lately. Modern times have caught up with the hero. He has been having a hard time being discrete. It seems that he has gone to great lengths to fix this problem. I have even heard rumors that he has enlisted the help of Batman in solving this problem but those attempts have ended in failure. Now it seems that Superman has taken to the woods. Good luck finding this cache but if you need help you can always PAF.</groundspeak:long_description>

   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">I was walking through the woods looking for a place to hide a cache and I came upon a cache container. After thinking ab;out it for a while I figured the cache had to be placed there by Superman. Superman has been having problems lately. Modern times have caught up with the hero. He has been having a hard time being discrete. It seems that he has gone to great lengths to fix this problem. I have even heard rumors that he has enlisted the help of Batman in solving this problem but those attempts have ended in failure. Now it seems that Superman has taken to the woods. Good luck finding this cache but if you need help you can always PAF.</groundspeak:long_description>

It appears that there is now a four string wonder right above the cache. Many people will be perhaps asking themselves, What is a Four String Wonder? Well I recommend you either go find this cache or ask WTWWTW. A very fun idea for a cache. Thanks for the fun one Steve.</groundspeak:text>

The 4-String Wonder found the cache first.  In his efforts to keep me from the cache he left a calling-card, not exactly a signature item, though it may have his signature on it.  TF another fun cache, great or I guess I should say "super" idea.  I wonder how many future cachers will say, hey, what is this?!!!</groundspeak:text>

Being excited about this great occasion I went with my daughter to the dug out were the couch was teaching the X's and the O's of the game.  He had all the five year old staring at the chalk board and scratching there five year old heads.  On the board was written the team name, Penguins,  and were all the players would be.  The board had this written on it.

I was so confused that I went to spy on the Red Woods teams chalk board.

Their coach had this written on the chalk board.

I wanted to grab a few caches this afternoon just to be out in the sun.  This was one of the finds. I'd solved this a while back and the only other time I went after it, the area was full of muggles.  Today it was deserted and I made a quick find and was on my way.  It was a neat puzzle.  TNLNSL. TFTC.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">{*FTF*} checked the new cache listings at work and saw this one.  Made quick work on the puzzle and having checked the result through geochecker knew where to go.  

Since the GPS was at home, printed the info and off I went after work.  Though there was a game going with plenty of muggles around, it wasn't hard to wait until they were watching the action before grabbing and later replacing the cache.

Thanks for the hide.

Then I remembered a similar micro container of this type and looked again more carefully. Signed the log waa on the back.
The other one I saw like this (GC1Q9PP) was a disappointment because I couldn't get it out of it's hiding spot.

My eyes aren't as good as they once were, so I didn't know what I was seeing at first.  I thought perhaps it was an unusual camo container, but when I touched it, I knew right away my first impression was wrong.  Cache containers are NOT alive.  [:O]  I'll include a photo of what I found.

I then spent a fairly long time looking for this cache.  Up and down.  All around.  In between, underneath, on the ground...  Everywhere but where it was located.  Until I finally found it, near where I had previously looked!  Ha!  Those micros can be tough.

There was a sailboat and several fishing boats on the lake this beautiful April afternoon.  We headed back down the trail, only to be stopped by a 3-ft black snake that was sunning himself across the trail.  Nickel was not happy to see a snake - Ken wanted to play with it [:)].

I grabbed this one after picking up [blue]MushroomBoy[/blue] at school. There was a muggle sitting at GZ with a grabber, so I was wondering if he was a cacher. He wasn't so I introduced him to Geocaching. He and his wife go to parks to pick up trash and had once picked up a cache at Pere Marquette. While I was signing the log, JimGin walked up and we both talked some more with the muggles. After we replaced the cache, I met JimGin's dog Maggie and then we headed for home. Thanks Evshro &amp; son,

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Geocaching on this gorgeous 63* January day was a MUST, and since Team Frog Cachers (TFC) and I had become geopals recently online, we definitely had to meet up and get some smileys [:)] at Simpson Park today. Our fun caching day was enhanced when we met up with some other cachers during our search for this one.  WhoFarted75 teamed up with us here and for 3 more at Simpson Park today, but we also met AlfredP and Larry at this location.  They are old cachers that hadn't cached or been GC.com members for several years, but knew just what we were doing and stopped their bike ride to relive some GC good times and ultimately share in our victory when we found this cache.  Even though you probably won't see a log from them, I signed their names on the cache log with ours.  I knew this container would be 'clever,' but I don't think the other cachers were ready for my puzzling look, big smile and head-shaking giggle when I actually discovered it.  We all got a kick out of it! Thanks for a real fun cache and my first experience of 'meeting up' with other cachers on a hunt.  I read about that happening alot, but it had never happened to me until today!! It was tons of fun and added yet another great aspect of geocaching for me.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I set out with the 4-String Wonder to learn more about the great battle of Valley Park, GC39FQD.  We hiked in but had a little trouble since our GPS went blank.  Fearing we had entered some sort of Bermuda Triangle we were of course very curious.  We continued to hike in, perhaps heading a little too far north.  It was there, just west of the lake, where we found an old monument to the battle.  This monument reminded us of a modern day folk hero of “highly modified” geocaching fame.  I signed the log and we headed out, not much wiser about the Battle of Valley Park, but more curious about the land to the north.  Fun stuff, nicely done, and good for some laughs.</groundspeak:text>

We kept searching the wrong area, and were just about to give up when C3GPS and C3kid came by, so we joined forces with them. Within a few minutes IBEW Ret found the cache.  Thanks, stewy1966!

[blue]Blue[/blue] &amp; I got here and I saw somebody with a hooded jacket near the cache putting his gloves back on. My first thought was he beat me to the cache but he was a muggle walking his dog. So we proceeded to the coordinates and after a short search I spotted something. I almost fell in the lake when I saw it. I showed it to [blue]Blue[/blue] and she jumped in the lake to get away from it. The only nice thing about it was a nice blank logbook for me to deface. I would deface the rest of the cache but I was afraid of what Medusa might do to me if I looked any longer. Thanks Stewy,

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Dang it ....Rainman must have a better GPS than me, cause mine took me back and forth within 25 ft or so today....but it was right before the storm, so that might have thrown it off.  Anyway, after about 20 mins and a few thorn scratches, (and of course taking the hard way in to come at it from behind), my muggle husband and I finally found it and SL.  I need to start trusting my 'growing geo-sense' because I was right in front of it initially and made a 'winter' hiding-place comment, but GZ wasn't zeroed in, so we kept moving around.  Sure enough it was in the spot I'd thought from the beginning before really starting the 'search.'   Maybe in the winter this cache is is difficulty 1, but I think it's a 2 in the summer, with overgrown paths and underbrush etc.  Beware of thorny vines if you bushwack like me [:P].

I tried the stick method as posted by a previous finder but that just wasn't working for me. So I took my dog around the lake to find Stewy1966....he wasn't much help either. As I was returning, I took the sunglasses off my face and realized that the earpiece along with the stick might be just the right tool. It still took me a while, but I did sign the log. I didn't expect the container to be so long, which is why my first attempt didn't work.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Geocaching on this gorgeous 63* January day was a MUST, and since Team Frog Cachers (TFC) and I had become geopals recently online, we definitely had to meet up and get some smileys [:)].  Our fun caching day was enhanced when we met up with some other cachers around the lake and teamed up with WhoFarted75 for our last 4 of 6 at Simpson Park today.  After most of the park muggles left, we hunted down Bubbles Treasure.  Thanks for the cache and the hint to bring TOTT.  GZ was spot on and TFC found this one immediately and my geotweezers were able to retrieve it with little difficulty.</groundspeak:text>

[b][purple]Crowesfeat30[/b][/purple], [blue]Blue[/blue] &amp; I got here and started looking around. We had to leave [blue]Blue[/blue] back on shore as we looked since she refused to go on that dock. We tried way too hard for this one, but finally located it and finally got it from it's hiding place. Thank you slbz8b for a fun cache,
