And if people-watching gets tiresome, there's always bird-watching; the best times to spot the more reclusive creatures are in the earliest hours of sunrise and at dusk. All the hides in the "simple series" are hidden within 25' of the bike trail. i kept all the caches out of poison ivy. but there is definitely some near all of these caches. lastly, a few of these caches are large with trinkets for the young and young at heart and are easy finds. there are a few caches that are small but you should find verily easily. but also there a few that are evil! they will take some time &amp;amp; effort on your part figuring out kid dylan's mind set.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Of all the Madison County Trails, this is my favoiriate spot.  This is such a neat area, particularly since the water was up.  Thanks for having a cache at this special location.  

Got out today on the GC Heritage Trail, looks like the work for the new pavement will begin shortly.   Hope it gets done soon.  I am alergic to grass pollen and once I got out of the woods on the trail, the grass was in full bloom and not cut.  So I had to pass by almost all the caches I was going to do today since I would have had to go through the grass.  O well they will be there for another day.  Had a great day and ride.  Thanks for the caches.

It looked like it got ran over and someone tried to fix it with black tape.  We had some black tape as well and tried to get the lid to stay on, but it's not very good.  The coordinates took us to the middle of the trail, so we added a log and placed it by a large tree at N 38° 46.950  W 089°  51.426.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Got out today on the GC Heritage Trail, looks like the work for the new pavement will begin shortly.   Hope it gets done soon.  I am alergic to grass pollen and once I got out of the woods on the trail, the grass was in full bloom and not cut.  So I had to pass by almost all the caches I was going to do today since I would have had to go through the grass.  O well they will be there for another day.  Had a great day and ride.  Thanks for the caches.

We had a really good time caching our way along the bike path. We had the worst luck with the "easy" caches, and it seems like we could find the difficult ones before we even got off our bikes. We found over 100 caches in one day, so I can't complain too much. TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

The feel of the trail is a mix of suburban and rural, and the many people on the trail demonstrate that diversity. The flat, chip-and-seal surface is good for jogging, so many runners signed up for the Chicago Marathon use the trail as a training ground. And if people-watching gets tiresome, there's always bird-watching; the best times to spot the more reclusive creatures are in the earliest hours of sunrise and at dusk. All the hides in the "simple series" are hidden within 25' of the bike trail. i kept all the caches out of poison ivy. but there is definitely some near all of these caches. lastly, a few of these caches are large with trinkets for the young and young at heart and are easy finds. there are a few caches that are small but you should find verily easily. but also there a few that are evil! they will take some time &amp;amp; effort on your part figuring out kid dylan's mind set.

We had a really good time caching our way along the bike path. We had the worst luck with the "easy" caches, and it seems like we could find the difficult ones before we even got off our bikes. We found over 100 caches in one day, so I can't complain too much. No luck for us today.</groundspeak:text>

   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Heritage Bike Trail forms part of more than 85 miles of rail-trails. The feel of the trail is a mix of suburban and rural, and the many people on the trail demonstrate that diversity. The flat, chip-and-seal surface is good for jogging, so many runners signed up for the Chicago Marathon use the trail as a training ground. And if people-watching gets tiresome, there's always bird-watching; the best times to spot the more reclusive creatures are in the earliest hours of sunrise and at dusk. All the hides in the "simple series" are hidden within 25' of the bike trail. I kept all the caches out of poison ivy, but there is definitely some near all of these caches. Lastly, a few of these caches are large with trinkets for the young and young at heart and are easy finds. There are a few caches that are small but you should find verily easily yet there a few that are evil! They will take some time &amp;amp; effort on your part figuring out kid dylan's mind set.

And if people-watching gets tiresome, there's always bird-watching; the best times to spot the more reclusive creatures are in the earliest hours of sunrise and at dusk. All the hides in the "simple series" are hidden within 25' of the bike trail. I kept all the caches out of poison ivy, but there is definitely some near all of these caches. Lastly, a few of these caches are large with trinkets for the young and young at heart and are easy finds. There are a few caches that are small but you should find verily easily yet there a few that are evil! They will take some time &amp;amp; effort on your part figuring out kid dylan's mind set.

There are a few caches that are small but you should find verily easily yet there a few that are evil! They will take some time &amp;amp; effort on your part figuring out kid dylan's mind set.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Sorry for the late log, I'm trying to get caught up on my backlog of finds. I spent the day caching with SWAseeker. We had a really good time caching our way along the bike path. We had the worst luck with the "easy" caches, and it seems like we could find the difficult ones before we even got off our bikes. We found over 100 caches in one day, so I can't complain too much. No luck on this one.</groundspeak:text>

   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Heritage Bike Trail forms part of more than 85 miles of rail-trails. The feel of the trail is a mix of suburban and rural, and the many people on the trail demonstrate that diversity. The flat, chip-and-seal surface is good for jogging, so many runners signed up for the Chicago Marathon use the trail as a training ground. And if people-watching gets tiresome, there's always bird-watching; the best times to spot the more reclusive creatures are in the earliest hours of sunrise and at dusk. All the hides in the "simple series" are hidden within 25' of the bike trail. i kept all the caches out of poison ivy. but there is definitely some near all of these caches. lastly, a few of these caches are large with trinkets for the young and young at heart and are easy finds. there are a few caches that are small but you should find verily easily. but also there a few that are evil! they will take some time &amp;amp; effort on your part figuring out kid dylan's mind set.

The feel of the trail is a mix of suburban and rural, and the many people on the trail demonstrate that diversity. The flat, chip-and-seal surface is good for jogging, so many runners signed up for the Chicago Marathon use the trail as a training ground. And if people-watching gets tiresome, there's always bird-watching; the best times to spot the more reclusive creatures are in the earliest hours of sunrise and at dusk. All the hides in the "simple series" are hidden within 25' of the bike trail. i kept all the caches out of poison ivy. but there is definitely some near all of these caches. lastly, a few of these caches are large with trinkets for the young and young at heart and are easy finds. there are a few caches that are small but you should find verily easily. but also there a few that are evil! they will take some time &amp;amp; effort on your part figuring out kid dylan's mind set.

   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Heritage Bike Trail forms part of more than 85 miles of rail-trails. The feel of the trail is a mix of suburban and rural, and the many people on the trail demonstrate that diversity. The flat, chip-and-seal surface is good for jogging, so many runners signed up for the Chicago Marathon use the trail as a training ground. And if people-watching gets tiresome, there's always bird-watching; the best times to spot the more reclusive creatures are in the earliest hours of sunrise and at dusk. All the hides in the "simple series" are hidden within 25' of the bike trail. i kept all the caches out of poison ivy. but there is definitely some near all of these caches. lastly, a few of these caches are large with trinkets for the young and young at heart and are easy finds. there are a few caches that are small but you should find verily easily. but also there a few that are evil! they will take some time &amp;amp; effort on your part figuring out kid dylan's mind set.

The feel of the trail is a mix of suburban and rural, and the many people on the trail demonstrate that diversity. The flat, chip-and-seal surface is good for jogging, so many runners signed up for the Chicago Marathon use the trail as a training ground. And if people-watching gets tiresome, there's always bird-watching; the best times to spot the more reclusive creatures are in the earliest hours of sunrise and at dusk. All the hides in the "simple series" are hidden within 25' of the bike trail. i kept all the caches out of poison ivy. but there is definitely some near all of these caches. lastly, a few of these caches are large with trinkets for the young and young at heart and are easy finds. there are a few caches that are small but you should find verily easily. but also there a few that are evil! they will take some time &amp;amp; effort on your part figuring out kid dylan's mind set.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Found cache. Since I parked at the trail head way down in Horseshoe Lake State Park and rode my bike up the Nickel Plate Trail into Edwardsville, IL, I was pretty much tuckered out by the time I made it to this location. Of course, I missed my turn-off for the Goshen Trail which would have saved me some mileage, but eventually made it hear. Needed to find this "large" container for it will be #6 container type in order to complete a "7 container types in 1 day challenge" in the Kansas City, KS/MO area. Just need a virtual now. Anyway, thankfully, this was a quick find. Will have to park closer to this location and search for more caches later in the week. Cache in good shape. TN/LN/SL.</groundspeak:text>

We had a really good time caching our way along the bike path. We had the worst luck with the "easy" caches, and it seems like we could find the difficult ones before we even got off our bikes. We found over 100 caches in one day, so I can't complain too much. TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Heritage Bike Trail forms part of more than 85 miles of rail-trails. The feel of the trail is a mix of suburban and rural, and the many people on the trail demonstrate that diversity. The flat, chip-and-seal surface is good for jogging, so many runners signed up for the Chicago Marathon use the trail as a training ground. And if people-watching gets tiresome, there's always bird-watching; the best times to spot the more reclusive creatures are in the earliest hours of sunrise and at dusk. All the hides in the "simple series" are hidden within 25' of the bike trail. i kept all the caches out of poison ivy. but there is definitely some near all of these caches. lastly, a few of these caches are large with trinkets for the young and young at heart and are easy finds. there are a few caches that are small but you should find verily easily. but also there a few that are evil! they will take some time &amp;amp; effort on your part figuring out kid dylan's mind set.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Got out and had a nice bike ride and got some caching done.  As soon as I left I got cold and went back to the car to get another coat.  I took it off at the first cache and never put it back on.  Wish I had brought my walking stick instead.  Near the begining there was a couple with two dogs off leash.  When I would get to a cache they would get real close and I did would move on before getting the cache and hurry to the next one.  But the caches were so close as soon as I would get there and before I could find it they were upon me again and I did not want to deal with leap frogging them so I would go on.  Finally they were far enough apart where I coulld get well ahead of them.  Well now I have more caches to do the next time I do this trail.  Yea and I could not find wired again.  Thanks for some great caches.

   <groundspeak:short_description html="True">a really simple cache in my simple minded series</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Heritage Bike Trail forms part of more than 85 miles of rail-trails. The feel of the trail is a mix of suburban and rural, and the many people on the trail demonstrate that diversity. The flat, chip-and-seal surface is good for jogging, so many runners signed up for the Chicago Marathon use the trail as a training ground. And if people-watching gets tiresome, there's always bird-watching; the best times to spot the more reclusive creatures are in the earliest hours of sunrise and at dusk. All the hides in the "simple series" are hidden within 25' of the bike trail. i kept all the caches out of poison ivy. but there is definitely some near all of these caches. lastly, a few of these caches are large with trinkets for the young and young at heart and are easy finds. there are a few caches that are small but you should find verily easily. but also there a few that are evil! they will take some time &amp;amp; effort on your part figuring out kid dylan's mind set. (what mind?)</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">F/T/F 244!!!  this was a real snake in the grass.  not really,  but it is definitely a side winders trail to get to it.  i had the afternoon off so i decided to go caching and get "observing" which is close by.   when i got to observing, i saw that the trip to get the cache was going to take longer then i had time to do.  so i headed home.  well a few minutes later i got a "ding"  that a new cache had come out and i was 2.8 miles away.  way cool.  i got to within 300' in just a few minutes.  but the last 300' took me a good 20 minutes.  not lots of bushwhacking, but plenty of s curves.  thanks satellite for making this a memorable afternoon,  for that i am awarding it a fave point

   <groundspeak:short_description html="True">another cache in the simple cache series. i have been to 27 Dylan concerts. and every time Uncle Bob would do a great job. he would say I "nailed" that one. this is another evil style one!  IT IS NOT UNDER THE BRIDGE</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Heritage Bike Trail forms part of more than 85 miles of rail-trails. The feel of the trail is a mix of suburban and rural, and the many people on the trail demonstrate that diversity. The flat, chip-and-seal surface is good for jogging, so many runners signed up for the Chicago Marathon use the trail as a training ground. And if people-watching gets tiresome, there's always bird-watching; the best times to spot the more reclusive creatures are in the earliest hours of sunrise and at dusk. All the hides in the "simple series" are hidden within 25' of the bike trail. i kept all the caches out of poison ivy. but there is definitely some near all of these caches. lastly, a few of these caches are large with trinkets for the young and young at heart and are easy finds. there are a few caches that are small but you should find verily easily. but also there a few that are evil! they will take some time &amp;amp; effort on your part figuring out kid dylan's mind set. (what mind?)</groundspeak:long_description>

   <groundspeak:short_description html="True">another cache in the simple cache series. i have been to 27 Dylan concerts. and every time Uncle Bob would do a great job. he would say I "nailed" that one. this is another evil style one!  IT IS NOT UNDER THE BRIDGE</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Heritage Bike Trail forms part of more than 85 miles of rail-trails. The feel of the trail is a mix of suburban and rural, and the many people on the trail demonstrate that diversity. The flat, chip-and-seal surface is good for jogging, so many runners signed up for the Chicago Marathon use the trail as a training ground. And if people-watching gets tiresome, there's always bird-watching; the best times to spot the more reclusive creatures are in the earliest hours of sunrise and at dusk. All the hides in the "simple series" are hidden within 25' of the bike trail. i kept all the caches out of poison ivy. but there is definitely some near all of these caches. lastly, a few of these caches are large with trinkets for the young and young at heart and are easy finds. there are a few caches that are small but you should find verily easily. but also there a few that are evil! they will take some time &amp;amp; effort on your part figuring out kid dylan's mind set.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Geocaching with Mean Gene, logging caches as "MG/RO", on typical Autumn weekend -- sprinkles in the morning, breezy in the afternoon. We spent a lot of time in the vicinity of a yellow-headed railroad spike that seemed to fit the coordinates and the cache title, but rereading the logs and description and digging around in the area netted nothing but dust and rotted wood. Thanks, Kid Dylan, for placing this cache! -- roelsch, St. Charles, MO.</groundspeak:text>

Well...my original Pipe Dream container was mowed over and has now "disappeared".  I searched through the grass in small hope of finding it (it was Really Really cool if you've never seen it) but sadly I think it is gone.  Maybe in the fall/spring it will show up, but I'm not counting on it...mowers can be ruthless!

So newish container but same theme...tried to put it nearer to the original location (but out of mowing range) but as I was wandering in to place it, a GIANT Black snake slithered around.  While I LOVE my "blackmamba0613", I am NOT a fan of snakes otherwise...nor do I think many cachers are.  So I thought better of the location and tried something a bit further away but close enough to the original location.

I will keep the difficulty the same for now...if you think differently, let me know.  Will adjust terrain rating slightly!

Cache on my friends!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">#1,405.  Absolutely evil cache.  It's amazing how difficult a cache can be if the coords are off by just 10 ft or so.  We had perhaps 4-6 experienced cachers that couldn't find the cache.  Doc finally broke down and called the CO. We a little prompting, my mother (on her first trip caching) came up with this one.  Very nicely done.  We really enjoyed the caches.

Got a little sick at this cache and had to rely on my friends to sign me in.  This one was truly E'ville!  

Thank you for placing this cache!

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Congrats to Kid Dylan for being FTF, and to sk8er72 for being a close second&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Frickenstein Family Cemetery&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This cemetery is located in Section 24 of Edwardsville Township, N.E.Section, formerly accessible only on private property at Gerber Road and North of Goshen Road. When inventoried it appeared that possibly removals had been done or attempted. At this time there are only three stones with a small iron fence surrounding them and they are located to the left of the entrance to the new subdivision on Goshen Road.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There is a memorial stone at Woodlawn Cemetery (West side of Edwardsville) which would indicate that there has been no removals- See Section 1 in Woodlawn for Frickinstein and Varner.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Frickenstin, F.W. 1800 - 1865&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
- Eliza b. 19 Aug 185- - d. 19 Oct 1860. Eliza is believed to be daughter of J.J.&amp;amp; N.Varner, as listed below. This stone is broken and partly embedded in tree around which all the stones are concentrated (the tree has recently been cut down).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Varner, Julia, daughter of J.J.&amp;amp; N.Varner, d. 20 Jul 1857 There are dove engravings on the stones of both Eliza &amp;amp; Julia.&lt;br /&gt;

After making the cache find, signing the log, we had to look for Docster's pen.  Funny thing is, I don't even know if he did get his pen back.  I found Hello Kitty gel pens at Target the following day, to buck up his spirits, but he didn't seemed to excited by the thought of carrying around Hello Kitty while geocaching.  Hey, I tried to be a good friend!  :P  Thank you for placing, yet another E'ville Cache!  DellsF4m

She searched right past it without realizing what it was. After my wife found it, she told us that she saw it, but thought it was something else.  Good idea.  TFTC.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">OCW Jaederbug, Docster68, Pharmgirl, Tsnake, and our families...  This one confused me at first.  I was thinking outside the box, perhaps, and thought we needed to do something more with this log.  But...it jumpstarted some new cache ideas...I just might act on the voices in my head...  Anyway, I would have signed the log, but I didn't want to set a bad example for my daughter, by playing with knives!  (J/K)  Thank you for placing this cache!  DellsF4m

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">#1,402.  Met up with Doc, Dells and families to do a little caching along the bike trail.  This was my mother's first caching trip.

This one took us a lot longer than it should have.  I probably nearly stumbled upon this one several times without coming up with it.  Luckily, Doc's daughter was able to root it out.  Got the lettle/number combo and moved to the next cache. TFTC.

The feel of the trail is a mix of suburban and rural, and the many people on the trail demonstrate that diversity. The flat, chip-and-seal surface is good for jogging, so many runners signed up for the Chicago Marathon use the trail as a training ground. And if people-watching gets tiresome, there's always bird-watching; the best times to spot the more reclusive creatures are in the earliest hours of sunrise and at dusk. All the hides in the "simple series" are hidden within 25' of the bike trail. I kept all the caches out of poison ivy. but there is definitely some near all of these caches. lastly, a few of these caches are large with trinkets for the young and young at heart and are easy finds. there are a few caches that are small but you should find verily easily. but also there a few that are evil! they will take some time &amp;amp; effort on your part figuring out kid dylan's mind set.
