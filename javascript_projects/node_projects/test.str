     "_": "(#2,358) I had gone into Maplewood to participate in a Coffee Crawl this morning… and filled up nicely on the caffeine with almost a dozen stops for locally-roasted coffee. That's probably [b]just[/b] what I needed in order to attack this one. It kept my eyes wide open and my energy level high.\r\n\r\nFar be it from me to say I found this one [i]right away[/i]… because I didn't. I stopped here and searched for 45+ minutes... searching for something similar to typical hides, other evil hides by this CO, evil hides I'd seen by other local COs... even looking for the mentioned object foot-by-foot around the area. I came up with nothing, zippo, nada. I was disappointed... but not particularly frustrated since I expected a 4.5-difficulty hide to contain a real possibility of DNF on the first (and maybe second and third and fourth) hunts.\r\n\r\nSo I left… knowing I'd be back again sometime soon since I pass by here on my way to and from work five days a week. I headed down to the next exit to try and avenge a DNF on a cache I had failed to find over there a year or two ago. After wasting another half hour or so over there on what [b]should[/b] have been an easy find… but apparently isn't… I got frustrated enough that I phoned a friend. It had been long enough since they found it that they didn't know where the cache was any more either. Oh well… at least I got a couple of nice pictures while I was in the area.\r\n\r\nBut while I was talking to my PAF… my brain was apparently still thinking about this cache as well. I looked at the logs and description again. The whole idea of \"think outside the box\" and \"expand your search\" seemed to indicate I wasn't looking in the right manner. Maybe that's the problem… I was looking for something I'd seen before… or at least something highly similar… and a 4.5 difficulty Strider cache probably wasn't that.\r\n\r\nSo after I got off the phone at my Tyson DNF… I looped my way around the appropriate I-44 exits and made my way back to ground zero for this one. If the coordinates were accurate (and Strider's usually are)… then that should narrow the search area quite a bit. But the sage advice of \"outside the box\" and \"expand the search\" sunk in enough that I started looking at things differently. It took awhile… but finally… something caught my eye. Something was there that I couldn't justify as belonging. Going with that thought… and hoping I was seeing and thinking right… I looked a little more. After a lot of concentration and a lot of time… I managed to come up with the digits I needed.\r\n\r\nAfter plugging the new coordinates into my GPS… I plotted my best plan of attack on ground zero of the final. I set out in that direction… and grabbed my walking stick since the terrain level of \"3\" indicated I might need it. And I was glad I did too. It was ultimately very helpful in the trek to the cache since one of my knees was acting up this afternoon.\r\n\r\nOnce I got to ground zero for the final… I got lucky that the first place I started poking my walking stick made an unexpected sound for where I stuck it. After moving a couple of things… a quick reach in with my hands confirmed that the spot was right and the coordinates were perfect. I took nothing from the cache… but left my signature, one of my pathtags and one of my signature item. Thanks for throwing a wrench in what I expect when looking for a cache, Jim! This was truly a fun few hours. [:D]",

Thanks Strider, all is well here. Now that we still have daylight [;)] we're heading on over to Chesterfield.",

Note to self when trying to read things on a phone increase the font size.  Did all my calculations and plugged them into the GPS and took off.  Got to the area of GZ and found myself on the back side of a public golf course.  Well thought to myself there must be some kind of park attached to the coarse and no one is playing golf today so parked the truck and started my way to GZ only to find myself in the middle of a fairway.  Okay back to the truck I go.  Then increased the font on my phone and seen where I made my mistake.  Yes the W 36 looked like a W38 the first time.  Made the correction and headed over to make the grab at 15:45hrs.  Yes 3 hours and 45 minutes after it was published and I was FTF.  I did not try to be FTF but it just happened that I was.  Glad there was no ordainment here so did not have to worry about leaving it for the next guy but still grabbing the cache. So that made 2 FTF (Day 3 and 13) and an assist on FTF on day 10.

Then we were more determined we look around the cliffs again and went up again, no luck back down we went found some trees with holes but no cache. With me on one side and Jason on the other we got it narrowed to 13 feet and closed in. We both had looked at this spot twice before but didn't see it.

We followed the trails this time... avoiding the bushwhack 'til we were only 100 feet from the cache. Then we decided to head off trail... straight into the woods where the GPS was pointing. Up to this point... we had been making our way via the ever-fading light of the sun which had already gone to hide beyond the horizon. But before we headed down into the woods... I donned my head lamp and Pastor G pulled out his flashlight. We needed them too!\r\n\r\nThe ground was steep and covered in mud and slippery leaves and ice-like mossy rocks. I almost fell a couple of times... and Pastor G landed on his tail at least once... and irreparably damaged his walking stick when loss of balance put all his weight on it in one incident. Finally... we found ourselves just 33 feet from the cache... and could almost smell it from there. But there was what looked in the dark like a 20+ foot muddy drop off right in front of us... between us and the cache. We looked around with our flashlights and headlamp and wandered back and forth for a few minutes... trying to figure out a way down... but could not see one in the foggy darkness.... no matter how hard we looked.\r\n\r\nFinally we headed back uphill to the trail... thinking we could always walk the bank from where we knew the trail met the creek. So we followed the trail to the creek and found that by now we were almost a third of a mile from the cache again... and it was getting late. We still had time though... and were waffling on whether to go for it.\r\n\r\nBut just as we made our way back across our balance beam towards the other bank... to try walking along there... it began to rain... and then to pour. And in just a few seconds we were drenched. We were only a tenth of a mile from the car... and we decided we had probably had enough of trying to pick our way around wet, treacherous hills in the dark... and so hurriedly walked up the hill to the car and dove in... then swapped out our rain-soaked shirts for what dry ones we had brought along.\r\n\r\nThankful for the one great find we had already made... we decided that having found the cache with the harder hike... we had done well for the evening... and should probably just head home. And so tonight... we leave this cache for another finder... as long as they don't wait too long.  [:D]",

    {
     "_": "(#2,370) After intentionally ignoring this cache and its friend out here yesterday so that I could be lazy and relax for a day... today it became too much and I texted Pastor G before I left work. I told him that I was seriously thinking about coming out here after work. The last cache the CO had placed out here had been such a fun one to go after... and I imagined that this one would be too. So with confirmation that he wanted to go along... I picked him up after running an errand out in Union... and off we set for Young Conservation Area.\r\n\r\nWe arrived at the parking lot with what was (I'm guessing) less than an hour 'til sunset. We set down the trail towards the creek and then when the trail veered from our intended direction... we left the trail to find a creek crossing that wouldn't require an extra half a mile out of our way of hiking. After wandering around on the edge of the creek for a couple of minutes... we found an appropriate crossing place and played \"balance beam\" across a log... arriving safe and dry on the other side.\r\n\r\nThen it was a third of a mile to the next waypoint I had marked ahead of time in my GPS... all uphill. The first push up was over 200 feet of elevation gain... taking us to one part of the ridge. But then came a little dip and another 100+ feet of elevation gain.... still following the ridgeline. Finally... a 50-foot drop and then almost 100 feet further up in elevation.\r\n\r\nBefore we knew it... we were only 150 feet from the cache. I followed my GPS in and realized I was going to need to back up and circumnavigate the huge tree between us and the cache. And so I did so. Heading straight for ground zero... I saw a place where I thought the cache [b]had[/b] to be hidden. So we began opening the hidey holes there... one layer at a time... finding nothing... and then more nothing... and finally - nothing.\r\n\r\nI looked down at my GPS and noticed it still put me as being 15 or 20 feet from the cache... and so I followed the arrow where it led. Even though the original location was well within the range of error (especially for this terrain)... we had exhausted what we considered all ways of hiding a \"regular\" cache there. So the actual location pointed to by the coordinates was open for searching. And after several minutes of looking with my flashlight and poking with my walking stick... I was about to give up on this hiding area as well.\r\n\r\nThen something caught my eye. Even though part of me wanted to say \"that's out of place\"... my eyes still said I was imagining things and everything there was fine. I almost didn't even check it... so convinced was I by the camo job. But a quick poke with my walking stick revealed that it wasn't the natural forest fare that it appeared to be. A couple more taps with my walking stick had me smiling and pulling the cache from its place.\r\n\r\nWe opened up the cache and pulled out the log... hoping that nobody had surreptitiously signed it today without logging it yet online. I opened the ziplock and then the logbook inside. Success! No signatures were to be found. So at 7:35 p.m... just 5 minutes before sunset... we signed our co-{FTF} on the first page of the log.\r\n\r\nI took the coin from Singapore... and left one of my pathtags and one of my signature items along with my signature on the log. Then we headed west areIFHR down the hill towards the trail... and the other cache. It didn't take long before we were finally on the trail in the direction we wanted to head... and we were on our way where we wanted to go. Thanks for an awesome hike for a wonderfully well-hidden cache this evening, konopapw!",

I haven't gotten around to seeing the recent movie yet... though I saw all the Lord of the Rings movies a couple of times. I reckon I'll get around to it eventually, though.\r\n\r\nAnyway... this is definitely one of my favorite books... and I enjoyed the reminder of it. I parked right in front of the actual ground zero... but my GPS was pointing over to the other side of the trail... so I headed over there and looked around for a good 5 minutes or so (in some [b]very[/b] nice hiding spots) before giving up and heading back to the car. I got back to the car and reread the description. That gave me encouragement to check one or two more locations... so I crawled back out of the car.\r\n\r\nThe first place I looked this time was right on the money!

This was a huge\r\nseries that everyone in SoCal looked forward to every year. For\r\nthis series a new cache will be placed everyday from twelve days to\r\nChristmas counting down till Christmas day. Last year in Cali\r\nbefore i moved here i had the opportunity to be a part of this\r\nseries with an FTF on one of the twelve caches. It was a great\r\nhonor to be a part of a select few for 2009. The creator of that\r\nseries in SoCal is Zombie Tribe. After all the madness of this\r\nseries, there was a great event where everyone that acquired an FTF\r\nthat year was presented with a custom tree ornament. Any ways I\r\nfelt I had to bring this series to STL for all to enjoy. The cache\r\nyou are seeking should be easy to find once at GZ. It is large\r\nenough for trade items and travel bugs/ coins. Please do your best\r\nto hide the cache as good or better than how you found it. Happy\r\nHunting and i hope everyone enjoys the series.\r\n<p>I\'d like to thank Spraypaint for creating a great puzzle for my\r\nCachemas in STL series.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\r\n"http://puzzles.theanaheimpirates.com/2010/giftbox/puzzle.png" /><br />\r\n</p><p>Additional Waypoints</p>',

When we got there... the [b]bottom[/b] of the cache was found where expected... but had a big block of ice that had formed in it from standing water... and was missing its log and lid. The log was found next... and then some poking around revealed the lid. Forest-Ghost signed the log while I cleaned out the ice and mud from the container and lid. Then I dropped in one of my signature item and we headed out of the woods. But before we headed back uphill... Forest-Ghost noted that there was a trail nearby... so we took the [b]easy[/b] way back to the car. Thanks for another Cachemas hide and a cool puzzle, Brandt!",

I got in a good walk along the way and soaked up some sunshine in the process. I also grabbed a cache that I'd DNF'd last year.  All in all, a great day. I really needed to get out and about since tomorrow is snowmageddon.  Gasp!!  \r\n\r\nAfter getting the other one in the park, I walked over to this one and had it in hand quickly. The area is wet and spongy but the cache is nice and dry.\r\n\r\nThis was # 5 of the 10 caches I found today. Thanks \"87preludea20a3\" for placing this cache.

But the cache was less than 500 feet away from us... so we had to at least look and see how bad this creek was... and if we could cross it while staying dry. A quick glance showed it not to be too large... and so off we set down one bank of the creek... then rock-hopping (though I think Forest-Ghost just walked on through with his rubber boots)... and up the other bank... and up the other bank... and [b]up[/b] the other bank... and then along the deer trail (real trail?) on the hillside 'til we were just a few feet from ground zero. Then off into the woods and down the hill we went. A couple pokes with my walking stick revealed the cache... hiding under a layer of snow. Took nothing... left my signature and one of my signature item. Thanks for another Cachemas find, Brandt!",

The tricks and techniques used in the simpler caches may be repeated in the later caches.<br />\r\nAfter all there are only so many ways I could find to make a birdhouse difficult to open.<br />\r\nAnd I hope that all of these birdhouses do not get too repetitive, I did try to change things up along the way as I often do.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSince the cache containers are bird houses, I figured why not a bird theme?<br />\r\nThe simpler ones will simply give you some info about a common bird in Missouri.<br />\r\n<big><strong>And the mystery caches you will have to figure out the common name of the bird based upon a picture or description in order to access the cache and sign the log.</strong></big><br />\r\n<big>I am not a fan of complicated difficult to solve puzzles, so I made these pretty easy.

    groundspeak_long_description: { _: '<p>To reach this cache, you will be walking down Hollywood Beach Road. This road, along with Bradley Beach road was once lined with nice homes and clubhouses which overlooked the Meramec River. The flood of 1973 was supposed to be a 100 year flood. The property owners re-built their homes, but in 1993, the waters of the Meramec River went even higher and with the help of FEMA monies, the City of Arnold started buying these properties. Some people still held out, but the floods of 1994 and 1995 caused the white flags to go up and by the end of 1995, 357 homes and trailer spots were purchased. After the flood of 2005, the city purchased another 500 residences in the flood plain. The total estimate came to just under 6 million dollars.</p>\r\n<p>When you walk down Hollywood Beach Road, you will see where mother nature has taken back the land that many homes use to occupy. As you walk, you will still see foundations that have stood the test of time. When you reach the above coordinates, you will find the Last Cabin that still exists in these neighborhoods. The log cabin has seen better days, but the roof is good, which may be why it is still here. When you open the unlocked front door, the cache container should be right inside. It is a coffee can that is big enough for trade items and trackables. Walk in and look around, just remember that other critters may also be inside, so use caution. Please close the door when you leave to keep the big critters from getting inside. Also, be cautious of the other foundations in the area. They may look sturdy, but the trees and vines have made the concrete crumble in spots. Have fun and enjoy the area and the view of the river.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additional Waypoints</p>PK4RHCC - GC4RHCC Parking<br />N 38° 27.365 W 090° 20.905<br /><br />',

So I drove down to the suggested parking and literally ran the .2 miles to GZ (Yeah, I'm in that kind of shape). Once I got there I couldn't wait for the challenge of possibly a new puzzle box to open. I saw what I was looking for, gathered my thoughts and prepared for a battle of wits. I reached up, pulled on the most obvious part of the cabin and it immediately opened up, revealing what appeared to be the final container. No, this couldn't be it. Had to be a trick. I took out the container, opened it up and found another smaller container. Wait, what? That's it? Ah well. I was too tired to think anyway.

And a few will be a challenge to figure out exactly how to open and sign the log.<br />\r\n<big><em>Most of them will be what I would call a field puzzle, and some are a combination of a field puzzle and mystery cache.</em></big><br />\r\n<strong>However there should be no need to force or break anything to gain access. So please leave the crowbars and hammers at home.</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nI would suggest doing these in numerical order. The tricks and techniques used in the simpler caches may be repeated in the later caches.<br />\r\nAfter all there are only so many ways I could find to make a birdhouse difficult to open.<br />\r\nAnd I hope that all of these birdhouses do not get too repetitive, I did try to change things up along the way as I often do.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSince the cache containers are bird houses, I figured why not a bird theme?<br />\r\nThe simpler ones will simply give you some info about a common bird in Missouri.<br />\r\n<big><strong>And the mystery caches you will have to figure out the common name of the bird based upon a picture or description in order to access the cache and sign the log.</strong></big><br />\r\n<big>I am not a fan of complicated difficult to solve puzzles, so I made these pretty easy. I just wanted to add a twist to signing the log.</big><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<big><strong>As a CO your logs and favorite points are my motivation, I read every log and am interested in hearing about your experience.<br />\r\nHope you enjoy the hunt!</strong></big></p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>Arnold City Park is located off Jeffco Blvd. and #1 Bradley Beach Road.<br />\r\nThe 68-acre park has an eight-acre fishing lake and four pavilions, each with electric and BBQ pits.<br />\r\nThe park also has two playgrounds, a paved 1/2 mile walking trail, two softball fields, two horseshoe pits, restrooms, and a tennis court.<br />\r\nA boat ramp off of Jeffco Blvd. next to Hollywood Beach Road provides parking and a picnic area.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nArnold City Park represents the largest of Arnold’s four active recreation open spaces.<br />\r\nThe park is 68 acres and is surrounded by 225 acres of City owned floodplain property.<br />\r\nThe park facilities currently include:<br />\r\n*an eight acre lake<br />\r\n* an asphalt walking trail approx (.75 mile)<br />\r\n* two baseball/softball fields<br />\r\n* a tennis court<br />\r\n* three pavilions with barbecue pits<br />\r\n* small family picnic areas with barbecue pits<br />\r\n* one playground<br />\r\n* restrooms<br />\r\n* two stages<br />\r\n* a small nature trail<br />\r\n* the beginning of trail system<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe adjoining floodplain properties are used by residents for hiking, running, biking, skating, fishing, and observing wildlife, vegetation and the River.<br />\r\nThe park can only be accessed from Jeffco Boulevard, just south of the Meramec River.<br />\r\nA road system exists in the floodplain area which gives floodplain users the opportunity to approach and park near the Meramec River.<br />\r\n<a href="http://www.arnoldmo.org/index.asp?Type=B_BASIC&amp;SEC=%7B64773124-41AB-4692-B7B0-B6E37E48C3A7%7D" style="margin:0px;padding:0px;font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;font-family:inherit;vertical-align:baseline;color:rgb(0, 160, 175);outline:0px;">Link to Arnold City Park page</a><br />\r\n<a href="http://www.arnoldmo.org/vertical/sites/%7BAF85B466-E495-4714-83DD-358A9D1E15C4%7D/uploads/%7BB52F7A58-9ED1-4267-9C05-FC9610C6757F%7D.PDF" style="margin:0px;padding:0px;font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;font-family:inherit;vertical-align:baseline;color:rgb(0, 160, 175);outline:0px;">Link to a printable pdf map of Arnold City Park</a><br />\r\n<a href="http://water.weather.gov/ahps2/hydrograph.php?wfo=lsx&amp;gage=arnm7" style="margin:0px;padding:0px;font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;font-family:inherit;vertical-align:baseline;color:rgb(0, 160, 175);outline:0px;">Link to National Weather Service to check Meramec river levels at Arnold, MO.</a></p>\r\n<div> </div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p> </p>',

The underparts are rich rusty red with white under the tail feathers. The female is paler than the male. The blackish throat is streaked with white. Juveniles are much like the adults, only heavily spotted with brown. The melodious song consists of a variety of three-note phrases strung together, sometimes seemingly endlessly. Calls include a “Pick! Tut-tut-tut.”</p>\r\n<p><strong style="line-height:22.5022506713867px;">Size:</strong> <span style="line-height:22.5022506713867px;">Length: 10 inches (tip of bill to tip of tail).</span></p>\r\n<p><strong style="line-height:22.5022506713867px;">Habitat and conservation:</strong> <span style="line-height:22.5022506713867px;">##### live in yards and other grassy places where they forage on the ground for earthworms; they are easily observed as they sing and call from trees, power lines and rooftops. Formerly killed for its meat, this species is protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the 1900 Lacey Act. It is also the species most memorable from Rachel Carson’s book “Silent Spring,” which illustrated how insect-eating birds can be killed indirectly from poisons intended for plant-eating insects.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong style="line-height:22.5022506713867px;">Foods:</strong> <span style="line-height:22.5022506713867px;">American #####s forage on the ground for earthworms, grubs and other insects, fruits and berries. They commonly run and stop, cock their head and pull earthworms from the ground.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong style="line-height:22.5022506713867px;">Distribution in Missouri:</strong> <span style="line-height:22.5022506713867px;">Statewide.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong style="line-height:22.5022506713867px;">Status:</strong> <span style="line-height:22.5022506713867px;">Common summer resident.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong style="line-height:22.5022506713867px;">Life cycle:</strong> <span style="line-height:22.5022506713867px;">#####s breed across North America, migrating northward from areas south of Canada in spring and migrating back south as far as southern Mexico in fall. #####s are found in Missouri year-round. They breed as soon as they arrive in spring, building nests of mud, grasses and twigs; there are usually 3-5 blue eggs per clutch, and usually 2-3 broods per season. The naked, helpless chicks hatch in 14 days; they fledge 14 days later but still require their parents’ help.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong style="line-height:22.5022506713867px;">Human connections:</strong> <span style="line-height:22.5022506713867px;">As a cherished symbol of springtime, the #####’s value to the human spirit is reflected in poetry and song. Because they often build nests that are easily seen, #####s are loved by bird watchers and children. #####s also busily devour grubs whose feeding can disfigure manicured lawns.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong style="line-height:22.5022506713867px;">Ecosystem connections:</strong> <span style="line-height:22.5022506713867px;">#####s eat many insects, helping to keep their populations in check. Young #####s and eggs are eaten by many predator species, and adults are taken by others. The warning calls #####s make when predators approach serve to alert other birds, who undoubtedly benefit from the #####s’ vigilance.</span></p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><span style="line-height:22.5022506713867px;">Arnold City Park is located off Jeffco Blvd. and #1 Bradley Beach Road.</span></p>\r\n<p>The 68-acre park has an eight-acre fishing lake and four pavilions, each with electric and BBQ pits.<br />\r\nThe park also has two playgrounds, a paved 1/2 mile walking trail, two softball fields, two horseshoe pits, restrooms, and a tennis court.<br />\r\nA boat ramp off of Jeffco Blvd. next to Hollywood Beach Road provides parking and a picnic area.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nArnold City Park represents the largest of Arnold’s four active recreation open spaces.<br />\r\nThe park is 68 acres and is surrounded by 225 acres of City owned floodplain property.<br />\r\nThe park facilities currently include:<br />\r\n*an eight acre lake<br />\r\n* an asphalt walking trail approx (.75 mile)<br />\r\n* two baseball/softball fields<br />\r\n* a tennis court<br />\r\n* three pavilions with barbecue pits<br />\r\n* small family picnic areas with barbecue pits<br />\r\n* one playground<br />\r\n* restrooms<br />\r\n* two stages<br />\r\n* a small nature trail<br />\r\n* the beginning of trail system<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe adjoining floodplain properties are used by residents for hiking, running, biking, skating, fishing, and observing wildlife, vegetation and the River.<br />\r\nThe park can only be accessed from Jeffco Boulevard, just south of the Meramec River.<br />\r\nA road system exists in the floodplain area which gives floodplain users the opportunity to approach and park near the Meramec River.<br />\r\n<a href="http://www.arnoldmo.org/index.asp?Type=B_BASIC&amp;SEC=%7B64773124-41AB-4692-B7B0-B6E37E48C3A7%7D" style="margin:0px;padding:0px;font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;font-family:inherit;vertical-align:baseline;color:rgb(0, 160, 175);outline:0px;">Link to Arnold City Park page</a><br />\r\n<a href="http://www.arnoldmo.org/vertical/sites/%7BAF85B466-E495-4714-83DD-358A9D1E15C4%7D/uploads/%7BB52F7A58-9ED1-4267-9C05-FC9610C6757F%7D.PDF" style="margin:0px;padding:0px;font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;font-family:inherit;vertical-align:baseline;color:rgb(0, 160, 175);outline:0px;">Link to a printable pdf map of Arnold City Park</a><br />\r\n<a href="http://water.weather.gov/ahps2/hydrograph.php?wfo=lsx&amp;gage=arnm7" style="margin:0px;padding:0px;font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;font-family:inherit;vertical-align:baseline;color:rgb(0, 160, 175);outline:0px;">Link to National Weather Service to check Meramec river levels at Arnold, MO.</a></p>\r\n<div> </div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additional Waypoints</p>FN5B8JB - Final Location<br />N 38° 27.029 W 090° 20.211<br />This series is a little different than any of my other series of caches.\r\nACP caches are a series of 14 birdhouses of varying sizes.\r\nThe difficulty is not in locating the caches, your GPS and eyesight will get you to GZ pretty easily.\r\nBut remember you must physically sign the log to claim the smiley.<br />',

Adult males are glossy, purplish blue overall, and may appear black in low light. Females and young males are light gray below.  _ _ _ _ _ _  ######s sing and are often on the wing a few hours before dawn. Song is a gurgling guttural warble. The call is a two-note “tchew-tchew” or “chur-chur.”</span></p>\r\n<p><strong style="line-height:22.5022506713867px;">Size:</strong> <span style="line-height:22.5022506713867px;">Length: 8 inches (tip of bill to tip of tail).</span></p>\r\n<p><strong style="line-height:22.5022506713867px;">Habitat and conservation:</strong> <span style="line-height:22.5022506713867px;">_ _ _ _ _ _  ######s are not well adapted to cold, rainy weather, and regional dieoffs may happen if these conditions persist for an extended time. Competition with introduced European starlings and house sparrows, which aggressively evict and sometimes kill young and adult martins, may also contribute to their population declines in some areas. Though originally cavity-nesters,######s now rely almost entirely on nest boxes humans provide for them.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong style="line-height:22.5022506713867px;">Foods:</strong> <span style="line-height:22.5022506713867px;">These aerial acrobats catch flying insects on the wing. They are not major predators of mosquitoes, which fly much lower than martins do. A martin colony, however, may catch and eat several hundred beetles, horseflies, grasshoppers, dragonflies, and wasps each day.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong style="line-height:22.5022506713867px;">Distribution in Missouri:</strong> <span style="line-height:22.5022506713867px;">Statewide.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong style="line-height:22.5022506713867px;">Status:</strong> <span style="line-height:22.5022506713867px;">Common summer resident in appropriate habitat, where nesting sites are available. Populations are declining over much of North America.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong style="line-height:22.5022506713867px;">Life cycle:</strong> <span style="line-height:22.5022506713867px;">######s begin arriving in Missouri in early March. There is usually only one brood a year. This gregarious species forms large flocks beginning in July. In August, martins gather in large flocks prior to fall migration. A nighttime roost in Springfield once contained over 30,000 birds. Such flocks join together as they migrate southward. In a few weeks they are on their winter range in southern Brazil. Millions of them roost in city parks in the state of Sao Paulo from November through January.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong style="line-height:22.5022506713867px;">Human connections:</strong> <span style="line-height:22.5022506713867px;">These endearing birds have a long history with humans on our continent. Native Americans provided gourd nests for them. You can help them survive by erecting and maintaining next boxes or gourds on your property. Plans and instructions are available from the Missouri Department of Conservation.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong style="line-height:22.5022506713867px;">Ecosystem connections:</strong> <span style="line-height:22.5022506713867px;">These acrobatic swallows hunt winged insects, helping to check the populations of those insects.</span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>Arnold City Park is located off Jeffco Blvd. and #1 Bradley Beach Road.<br />\r\nThe 68-acre park has an eight-acre fishing lake and four pavilions, each with electric and BBQ pits.<br />\r\nThe park also has two playgrounds, a paved 1/2 mile walking trail, two softball fields, two horseshoe pits, restrooms, and a tennis court.<br />\r\nA boat ramp off of Jeffco Blvd. next to Hollywood Beach Road provides parking and a picnic area.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nArnold City Park represents the largest of Arnold’s four active recreation open spaces.<br />\r\nThe park is 68 acres and is surrounded by 225 acres of City owned floodplain property.<br />\r\nThe park facilities currently include:<br />\r\n*an eight acre lake<br />\r\n* an asphalt walking trail approx (.75 mile)<br />\r\n* two baseball/softball fields<br />\r\n* a tennis court<br />\r\n* three pavilions with barbecue pits<br />\r\n* small family picnic areas with barbecue pits<br />\r\n* one playground<br />\r\n* restrooms<br />\r\n* two stages<br />\r\n* a small nature trail<br />\r\n* the beginning of trail system<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe adjoining floodplain properties are used by residents for hiking, running, biking, skating, fishing, and observing wildlife, vegetation and the River.<br />\r\nThe park can only be accessed from Jeffco Boulevard, just south of the Meramec River.<br />\r\nA road system exists in the floodplain area which gives floodplain users the opportunity to approach and park near the Meramec River.<br />\r\n<a href="http://www.arnoldmo.org/index.asp?Type=B_BASIC&amp;SEC=%7B64773124-41AB-4692-B7B0-B6E37E48C3A7%7D" style="margin:0px;padding:0px;font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;font-family:inherit;vertical-align:baseline;color:rgb(0, 160, 175);outline:0px;">Link to Arnold City Park page</a><br />\r\n<a href="http://www.arnoldmo.org/vertical/sites/%7BAF85B466-E495-4714-83DD-358A9D1E15C4%7D/uploads/%7BB52F7A58-9ED1-4267-9C05-FC9610C6757F%7D.PDF" style="margin:0px;padding:0px;font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;font-family:inherit;vertical-align:baseline;color:rgb(0, 160, 175);outline:0px;">Link to a printable pdf map of Arnold City Park</a><br />\r\n<a href="http://water.weather.gov/ahps2/hydrograph.php?wfo=lsx&amp;gage=arnm7" style="margin:0px;padding:0px;font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;font-family:inherit;vertical-align:baseline;color:rgb(0, 160, 175);outline:0px;">Link to National Weather Service to check Meramec river levels at Arnold, MO.</a></p>\r\n<div> </div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additional Waypoints</p>FN5B8K1 - Final Location<br />N 38° 26.821 W 090° 20.259<br /><br />',

Adult upperparts are dark bronzy purple, with an iridescent blue-green head and a bright yellow eye. The bill is long and slightly curved. The tail is long and curled upwards on the edges during the breeding season; males often fly with the tail held in a shallow V. Underparts are similar to upperparts. Females are similar, but duller and browner with a short, straight tail. Song is a harsh gurgling squeak: “kree del eeeek.” Call is a harsh “chlack.”</p>\r\n<p><strong style="line-height:22.5022506713867px;">Size:</strong> <span style="line-height:22.5022506713867px;">Length: 12½ inches (tip of bill to tip of tail).</span></p>\r\n<p><strong style="line-height:22.5022506713867px;">Habitat and conservation:</strong> <span style="line-height:22.5022506713867px;">Commonly seen in urban and rural areas, parks, farm lots, pastures, lawns, and lakeshores. Populations are strong continent-wide, though at 73 million birds they are no where near their historic peak of 191 million. Unlike the European starling, which is a nonnative invasive species, the common grackle is native to our continent and is a component of our nation’s natural inheritance.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong style="line-height:22.5022506713867px;">Foods:</strong> <span style="line-height:22.5022506713867px;">Common #######s forage on the ground for a variety of seeds, insects, aquatic animals, and even small mammals. Animal foods such as grubs are sought especially during nesting season, for the protein they provide the growing young. #######s are infamous corn and rice eaters, though they also help farmers by eating insect pests.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong style="line-height:22.5022506713867px;">Distribution in Missouri:</strong> <span style="line-height:22.5022506713867px;">Statewide.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong style="line-height:22.5022506713867px;">Status:</strong> <span style="line-height:22.5022506713867px;">Common summer and winter resident; uncommon in northern Missouri during winter.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong style="line-height:22.5022506713867px;">Life cycle:</strong> <span style="line-height:22.5022506713867px;">The creaky calling, purposeful strutting, and courtship displays of #######s are common signs of spring. Bulky nests are usually built in evergreens or other bushy trees and are constructed of twigs, grasses, and other materials, reinforced with mud. Clutches comprise 1-7 eggs, which hatch in 11-15 days. At first, the young make cheeping sounds, but their demanding voices become louder and creakier as they grow. They fledge in 10-17 days, then follow their parents as they forage on the ground.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong style="line-height:22.5022506713867px;">Human connections:</strong> <span style="line-height:22.5022506713867px;">It is believed that common ####### numbers jumped dramatically as American settlers converted the continent’s forests into cropland; our activities have expanded its habitat. #######s eat corn in nearly all stages of the crop’s development, and farmers consider them pests.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong style="line-height:22.5022506713867px;">Ecosystem connections:</strong> <span style="line-height:22.5022506713867px;">When #######s raid another bird’s nest, snap up grasshoppers, pick grubs from the soil, or pluck leeches from a turtle’s leg, they are predators. When they eat berries, they distribute seeds. The native seeds they ate before European settlement used to cover America’s once-vast grasslands.</span></p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>Arnold City Park is located off Jeffco Blvd. and #1 Bradley Beach Road.<br />\r\nThe 68-acre park has an eight-acre fishing lake and four pavilions, each with electric and BBQ pits.<br />\r\nThe park also has two playgrounds, a paved 1/2 mile walking trail, two softball fields, two horseshoe pits, restrooms, and a tennis court.<br />\r\nA boat ramp off of Jeffco Blvd. next to Hollywood Beach Road provides parking and a picnic area.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nArnold City Park represents the largest of Arnold’s four active recreation open spaces.<br />\r\nThe park is 68 acres and is surrounded by 225 acres of City owned floodplain property.<br />\r\nThe park facilities currently include:<br />\r\n*an eight acre lake<br />\r\n* an asphalt walking trail approx (.75 mile)<br />\r\n* two baseball/softball fields<br />\r\n* a tennis court<br />\r\n* three pavilions with barbecue pits<br />\r\n* small family picnic areas with barbecue pits<br />\r\n* one playground<br />\r\n* restrooms<br />\r\n* two stages<br />\r\n* a small nature trail<br />\r\n* the beginning of trail system<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe adjoining floodplain properties are used by residents for hiking, running, biking, skating, fishing, and observing wildlife, vegetation and the River.<br />\r\nThe park can only be accessed from Jeffco Boulevard, just south of the Meramec River.<br />\r\nA road system exists in the floodplain area which gives floodplain users the opportunity to approach and park near the Meramec River.<br />\r\n<a href="http://www.arnoldmo.org/index.asp?Type=B_BASIC&amp;SEC=%7B64773124-41AB-4692-B7B0-B6E37E48C3A7%7D" style="margin:0px;padding:0px;font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;font-family:inherit;vertical-align:baseline;color:rgb(0, 160, 175);outline:0px;">Link to Arnold City Park page</a><br />\r\n<a href="http://www.arnoldmo.org/vertical/sites/%7BAF85B466-E495-4714-83DD-358A9D1E15C4%7D/uploads/%7BB52F7A58-9ED1-4267-9C05-FC9610C6757F%7D.PDF" style="margin:0px;padding:0px;font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;font-family:inherit;vertical-align:baseline;color:rgb(0, 160, 175);outline:0px;">Link to a printable pdf map of Arnold City Park</a><br />\r\n<a href="http://water.weather.gov/ahps2/hydrograph.php?wfo=lsx&amp;gage=arnm7" style="margin:0px;padding:0px;font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;font-family:inherit;vertical-align:baseline;color:rgb(0, 160, 175);outline:0px;">Link to National Weather Service to check Meramec river levels at Arnold, MO.</a></p>\r\n<div> </div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additional Waypoints</p>FN5B8KF - Final Location<br />N 38° 26.740 W 090° 20.590<br /><br />',

We found all the birdhouse caches and was able to open all the containers. Your time and effort to put together this series is really appreciated. We said many times throughout the day how much we were enjoying the series and glad we did it as a group to share the fun. Kudos to Brad9018!",

A blue crest on the head can be raised or lowered depending on the bird’s mood. The back is rather lavender, and the wings and tail are sky blue with black bars and white highlights. The strong bill and feet are black; the face is white and is nearly surrounded by a black collar. The voice varies from soft murmurs to loud screams to clear, chime-like whistles.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Size:</strong> Length: 11 inches (tip of bill to tip of tail).</p>\r\n<p><strong style="line-height:22.5022506713867px;">Habitat and conservation:</strong> <span style="line-height:22.5022506713867px;">#### ###s are found wherever there are trees in our state, but although they are present year round, they migrate, so that the birds in any particular area might be replaced each season by others. Sometimes people see bald-headed #### ###s— #### ###s without feathers on their heads.

It was actually starting to feel pretty nice out at around 40 degrees. Looking at the tower... I wasn't sure what had made others balk at the climb. There were hand rails the whole way up... and the stairs were perfectly solid. The observation deck at the top was more enclosed than any other tower I've been in (admittedly only about three). Good thing too! Although the temperature on the ground was awesome... it was [b]freezing[/b] up at the top of the tower... mostly due to the fact that the wind was roaring around up there like crazy. So we sat down on the floor of the observation deck to do the quick calculations... and to enter the coordinates in our GPS units. Then we spent a bit of time taking pictures and enjoying the view before heading back down. Then off towards ground zero for the final. We got there and started looking, and poking, and prodding, and digging, and searching. Finally... Forest-Ghost came up with the find on the other side of an area I'd looked... but not gone around. I took nothing (but the code)... and left my signature and one of my signature item. This was definitely my favorite find of the day. I love the tower and the view it gave... and I appreciated the simple multi that required climbing it. Thanks for another great round of Cachemas goodness, Brandt!",
